      " Excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted. This is the director's most likeable film in ages, even if it's insubstantial, overlong and, frankly, a touch redundant. Arguably the most gifted young actor of his generation, Leonardo DiCaprio has definitely been a victim of his own success. Leo bashing was all the rage there for a while after his monster smash Titanic. Hanratty isn't a strictly factual character - he's called O'Reilly in the book, not his real name either - but the performance Hanks gives makes you wish he were. Abagnale isn't strictly factual either, but DiCaprio makes him an attractive counterfeit. This is a delectable film indeed. A fitting dessert to Spielberg's preceeding entree and main course of A.I. and Minority Report, and one hell of a ride. DiCaprio has the breeze and aplomb to keep it all bouncing along. Breezily enjoyable but thin. Spielberg rediscovers his sense of fun with this funny, frivolous con caper. A delicious cat-and-mouse game flecked with intriguing Oedipal undertones. A gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices. Catch Me if You Can is one of those deceptively slight offerings that manages to reveal more about its maker than the intended masterpieces often do. Most of the film is an extended chase, with Abagnale always one clever step ahead, and it's tense, good fun, if a tad underdeveloped. A pleasant, mildly diverting story. Spielberg perfectly re-creates the fashions, the mood and the trends of the '60s, and DiCaprio and Hanks have a lot of fun with their roles. It's Spielberg with the message turned off, a jaunty two hours and 20 minutes that returns the director to his first love: blissfully pure cinematic fun. After a series of dud roles, DiCaprio is back in star form. One of the most enjoyable films of the year. It's more amusing than hilarious, more cute than inspired, but there's just too much talent on and off the screen for it to fail. Spielberg's breeziest work in years. Breezy and entertaining&#133; essentially a celebration of the career of a con artist, [but] it celebrates his cleverness and panache rather than his dishonesty, and ends on a satisfyingly redemptive note. Offers mild fun but never as much as its animated '60s-retro opening credits portend. [Spielberg's] frothiest and most fun movie in years. Ultimately about fathers and sons -- but it's also about the pleasures of telling a good story, with retro charm to spare. The colorful cinematography, smart performances and brisk tempo suggest a filmmaker subordinating every other impulse to the task of manufacturing pleasure. Fleet-footed and fun, if a mite too long. Spielberg knows that he has a great yarn here, and he's not about to let anything -- not even his own virtuoso style, which can elsewhere be effectively glitzy -- get in the way. A very adult, very funny, very well-acted daydream that should delight just about anyone who's ever been asked for picture ID. This breezy caper movie becomes a soulful, incisive meditation on the way we were, and the way we are. DiCaprio gives a radiant, movie-star performance. The story is a good story, directly told, and such meaning as it has comes from the irony that the only person who completely appreciates Abagnale's accomplishments is the man trying to arrest him. The most charming of Mr. Spielberg's mature films, because is it so relaxed. Precisely what a mainstream movie should be: fleet, savvy and, like a good con, executed as if it were the easiest thing in the world. You won't find a movie that's more fun this season -- but at 2-1/2 hours, it's probably too much of a good thing. The movie feels like the work of a filmmaker who has earned himself a break. Because it's Spielberg, the audience gets to share in the party. A nice, light treat. Affirms the gifts of all involved, starting with Spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together. Mindful in many ways of Spielberg's very first feature, the good-natured fugitives-on-the run drama The Sugarland Express. Every single element of this movie works brilliantly together and the result is as irresistible as its con man hero. This is one of the most consistent and perfectly balanced films of Spielberg's career. Wildly entertaining from start to finish. Mr. Spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned. And they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor. It's a technically superb film, shining with all the usual Spielberg flair, expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team. If this fact-based tale of a wunderkind swindler suffers from the director's gigantism, it's still lighter on its feet than anything he's made since Jurassic Park. Never takes itself or its subjects too seriously, and contains more genuinely funny material than about 90% of the so-called 'comedies' found in multiplexes these days. One of Spielberg's most gratifying films--quick and charming and exciting without ever being too obvious about its intentions. DiCaprio, though 27 when the film was shot, has just the right touch of baby-cheeked deadpan innocence to make you believe in the schemes of this eager boy grifter. A meticulously directed, deliciously acted, humorously written work of skill, energy and imagination. That rarity of rarities, a mainstream American feel-good movie with both charm and intelligence. DiCaprio's winning performance goes a long way toward encouraging the viewer the forgive the film its indulgences and missteps. This is a lighter movie than [Spielberg] has made in a long while, and you sense his relief that nothing much is at stake. Excellent account of FBI's youngest Most Wanted. This is the director's most likeable film in ages, even if it's insubstantial, overlong and, frankly, a touch redundant. Arguably the most gifted young actor of his generation, Leonardo DiCaprio has definitely been a victim of his own success. Leo bashing was all the rage there for a while after his monster smash Titanic. Hanratty isn't a strictly factual character - he's called O'Reilly in the book, not his real name either - but the performance Hanks gives makes you wish he were. Abagnale isn't strictly factual either, but DiCaprio makes him an attractive counterfeit. This is a delectable film indeed. A fitting dessert to Spielberg's preceeding entree and main course of A.I. and Minority Report, and one hell of a ride. DiCaprio has the breeze and aplomb to keep it all bouncing along. Breezily enjoyable but thin. Spielberg rediscovers his sense of fun with this funny, frivolous con caper. A delicious cat-and-mouse game flecked with intriguing Oedipal undertones. A gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices. Catch Me if You Can is one of those deceptively slight offerings that manages to reveal more about its maker than the intended masterpieces often do. Most of the film is an extended chase, with Abagnale always one clever step ahead, and it's tense, good fun, if a tad underdeveloped. A pleasant, mildly diverting story. Spielberg perfectly re-creates the fashions, the mood and the trends of the '60s, and DiCaprio and Hanks have a lot of fun with their roles.

      " There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between bruce willis and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkeys. gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the fifth element) and handed it to butch bruce. it was entitled \"things bruce willis does when he acts\". it ended with a simple message saying: \"please don't do any of the above in my movie\".there is a fact about this movie (definitely true). gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.i would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is the twelve monkeys.visually, the twelve monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film. it is also full of gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. although the ending of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, gilliam borrows heavily from kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. it is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles.i love gilliam films (brazil, in particular). but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. he seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (brazil, in particular). i still maintain that brazil is gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that the twelve monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-python.whatever the truth of the rumour above, gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - brad pitt.it's been over a decade since this film was released. when i watched it again, i realised that it hadn't really aged. i had changed, of course. and this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. a first rate film. 8/10. This game is an action/adventure with combat. there are quite long periods with no combat but other times, you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters. the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life, and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest. the whole game is a quest. you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him. the game is from the mid 1990's and has to be played in dos. i used dosbox and was able to play the game quite well. the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky, but others look batter, but don't let that put you off the game. the game is very imaginative, its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere. not for young kids who likely wouldn't be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 might like this game. its a horror\\mystery\\action\\adventure\\combat combination.i thought it was a great game. its had to find now. maybe ebay. but remember its a dos game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers. would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use dosbox. oh, and the acting is very good too. The battleship potemkin was said to have been a favourite of charlie chaplin. it presents a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the russian battleship potemkin rebelled against their officers of the tsarist regime.the film is a textbook cinema classic, and a masterpiece of creative editing, especially in the famous odessa steps sequence in which innocent civilians are mown down in the bloodshed; the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by frenzied cross-cutting. the film contains 1,300 separate shots, and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics. the battleship potemkin is in the public domain, in some parts of the world. The feeling of the need to have someone play the role of arbiter of public taste and political correctness always manages to get under our skin. it does seem that these self-appointed, self-superior, pseudo-intellectual types do appear everywhere; be it in one's family, church or bowling league.these are the guys who would have society completely disregard and ignore all that went before us; unless, of course, whatever 'it' is does not fly in the face of today's \"acceptable\" language, mores and general \"standards\" of \"proper\" behavior.so it is that these latter day, high tech book burners have targeted a great deal of what was hollywood's greatest achievement; namely their participation in our own allied propaganda via their unselfishly crafted message and theme films.coldly brutal in its generation, the banned code and list of now unacceptable extends into the wartime cartoons that don't meet with the new touchy, feely socially engineered 'official' attitudes; which these \"thought police\" have foisted down upon us.we were truly surprised to see that there seem to be volumes of such animated short subjects. the majority we are aware of are from warner brothers' looney tunes and merrie melodies; featuring bugs, daffy, elmer & porky, all in conflict with hitler, goerring, 'il duce', tojo and the like. surprisingly though, we found an ample supply of cartoons from mgm, walt disney, lantz, paramount-famous studios and the brothers fleischer.you're a sap mr. jap (famous studios/paramount pictures, 1942) is a prime example of just what we're talking about.being virtually indiscernible from the cartoons that were the output of the studios of max and dave fleischer before the 1941 business coup-de-tat that moved them out, bringing the new name of \"famous\" studios, you're a sap mr. jap bore none of the bland plot elements that would reduce the latter day popeye cartoons down to the level of the ultimate formula short movie.we all remember how we'd have popeye and olive oyl together. enter bluto, usually the exponent of wolf whistle and an on acceptable on-screen version of a male reaction to feminine pulchritude. olive falls for bluto's less than honorable attentions; until he gets a little too physical and invariably blurts out, \"hey babe, how 'bout a kiss?\" at this point we hear \"help! help, popeye and the diminutive sailor shows up to save the day; replete with the obligatory can of spinach! do we exaggerate, schultz? once again this jap sap cartoon is nothing like any of that. oh sure, it follows the storyline of now having popeye in the u.s. navy. the brothers fleischer put the little guy in the service in 1941 to conform to the mood in the country and as an open gesture of support for the men now being conscripted in the first peacetime draft in united states history. max and dave even put popeye in service aboard the mythical battleship, the u.s.s. pensyltucky.our point is just this. you're a sap mr. jap and others like spinach fer britain aren't cartoon vehicles for comic relief in the theatre's program at all in the true sense. rather they are a sort of grouping of editorial cartoons much like those from any \"great metropolitan newspaper\". these animated shorts, much like those still one panel illustrations, have characters that are highly symbolic and representative of nations, ideas and ideals, such as a just and lasting peace. in most cases, the hero (popeye, bugs bunny or whoever) is alone with the symbol of the enemy. both are highly exaggerated visual metaphors for abstract concept and thought; even if they are cloaked in humorous trappings for wider palatability.our liberal stupidgencia (the antithesis of intelligencia) may not see themselves this way; but for this sort of behavior, they are no more than neo nazi book burners.please, allow the future generations to view and appreciate a view of past happenings that is both historical and humorous.poodle schnitz!!. Gilmore girls is my favorite tv show of all times. they only aired the first 2 seasons in india but i've watched the rest on dvd or read it online. it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't sneaking around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. the chemistry between lauren graham and alexis bledel who play lorelai and her daughter rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, though extremely quirky, are still believable. the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life, which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of lorelai's parents. on one hand there are dance-athons and firelight festival's while on the hand you have cotillions, dar meetings and cocktail parties. all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend lane's. basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended. North and south (1985): patrick swayze, james read, lesley anne down, wendy kilbourne, terri garber, kirstie alley, genie francis, phillip casnoff, jean simmons, john stockwell, lewis smith, david carradine, inga swenson, jonathan frakes, wendy fulton, erica gimpel, tony frank, jim metzler, olivia cole, andy stahl, william ostrander, george stanford brown, robert mitchum, morgain fairchild, johnny cash, hal holbrook, gene kelly, david ogden stiers, john anderson, lee bergere, olivia de havilland, elizabeth taylor, forest whitaker, robert jones, ....director richard t. heffron, teleplay...paul f. edwards, patricia green, douglas heyes, kathleen a. shelley.based on john jake's successful paperback novels \"north and south\", \"love and war\" and \"heaven and hell\", this was a mini series on television from 1985 to 1987. its success owed more to the success of \"roots\" a similar civil war era/slavery soap opera televised about a decade earlier in the 70's. patrick swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was doing many films like dirty dancing which would make him famous, stars as orry main, a plantation-born young man from south carolina who sets off to west point. here he meets george hazard (james read) who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the yankee north, but with whom he bonds closely. soon, the mains from the south and the hazards from the north become friends despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. the theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing even when the nation was falling apart is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. clariss and ashton (jean simmons and teri garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries yankee billy hazard (john stockwell. garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil ashton is fun to watch on screen. though the series didn't cover everything in jakes' novels, what we see is a condensed version of it and they changed a few things to make it a sort of historical romance with history lessons attached. the characters find themselves in all the major civil war scenes - harper's ferry where abolitionist and feminist virgilia hazard (kirstie alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave grady, fort sumter, vicksburg, antietam, gettysburg, appomatox and we are privy to the white house where we see abraham lincoln (hal halbrook) battle out the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players including lee, grant, sherman, jackson and davis. several veteran hollywood actors from the golden era - robert mitchum, elizabeth taylor and olivia de havilland have cameos and it's interesting to see them. this is not historical fact, it's historical fiction and purely dramatized entertainment. but it's got cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. it is like watching an epic movie that runs longer than gone with the wind with with war scenes in it! the script may be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. swayze hams it up as does terri garber but some performances, like that of kirstie alley, james read (as george hazard)and leslie anne downes as the beautiful and strong madeline are really good performances. they shot in sets and in southern locations.the music is enchanting and this is a feel good film in which we root for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and ultimately get their comeuppance. all fans of civil war movies and the jakes novels should watch this. it's available on dvd and vhs. I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. it provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. they are also the official broadcasters of e3 and comiccon. if you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. they have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). it's the only place that i get my tech info. kevin pereira and olivia munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... universe. if you know those universes you will understand the jokes. long story short, aots is a hilarious show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything that you care about. i'm watching it right now as i type this, they are 'in' san diego covering the red bull air races. sweet. First off, anyone looking for meaningful \"outcome oriented\" cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated, emotive, heartfelt thespians, please leave now. you are wasting your time and life is short, go see the new brangelina jolie movie, have a good cry, go out & buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better, and leave us alone.don't let the door hit you on the way out either. the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young, tv friendly cast & crew, and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects, wakes up in a hospital, and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump. the melting man is played by one alex rebar, who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film. but once he starts oozin' with rick baker's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny, viscous blebs of grease.the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points: there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care, really. it's a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it -- one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out. hilarious.the \"hero\" of the film is played by burr debenning, a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s & 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype; slightly twisted, neurotic, and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused. he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead (or the alien zone) that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma, which is where i suspect this film was made as well. the arid, cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same, and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning ... which also had a sick sense of humor, a tv friendly cast, and some pretty outrageous gore. i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies, as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man's cast.essentially, as others have pointed out, this is a 1950s b movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects & the inevitable boobs. the movie it probably borrows most of it's ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree. one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man's motivations: he simply goes on a rampage and the movie's drama comes from wondering if he's going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness. the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen, rick baker's disgusting effects getting the lion's share of whatever was spent on this.sick, disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer. why can't people have made more movies like these? 8/10. This movie was incredible!!!! i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it unfold before me on dvd. it had many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting. the acting by elaine cassidy was in a word brilliant as well as sally hawkins. the storyline is rich with plausible occurrences as well as fresh ideas from the present.there is truly something about ms. cassidy's eyes that leaves \"a mark.\" this movie is a refreshing look on the way in which we look at the 'victorian times' and how we view that society. a very worthwhile watch. Having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go, one can do nothing but doff one's hat - a pure masterpiece, which compared to the other le carré minis about smiley, has quite different qualities.in the minis about smiley, it is alex guiness, as smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him, one can say.here it is ensemble and story that's important, as the lead actor, played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes, isn't charismatic at all. egan just plays a guy called magnus pym, who by lying, being devious and telling people what they like to hear, is very well liked by everyone, big and small. the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex, his czech handler.never have the machinery behind a spy, and/or traitor, been told better! after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy', as his czech handler calls him. and, by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path, once you've veered off it. he trundles on, even if he never get anything economic out of it, except promotion by his mi5 spy masters. everyone's happy, as long as the flow of faked information continues! magnus's father, played wonderfully by ray mcanally, is a no-good con-man, who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money. in later years it is his son who has to bail him out, again and again. but by the example set by his dad and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mom is sent off to an asylum, magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving, not telling the truth. at first he overdoes it a bit, but quickly learn to tell the right lies, and to be constant, not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad.his czech handler alex, expertly played by rüdiger weigang, creates, with the help of magnus, a network of non-existing informants, which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years, and years, just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned, liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 men.the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, little more cynic, and tired, pym, played by egan. but you buy the difference easily, as that is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to sorrow, or indifference.indeed well worth the money!. Plot spoilers!!!! dr. boch (george c. scott) is the chief of medicine at a major nyc hospital. he's left his wife, his children have disowned him, he's impotent, drinks a lot and contemplates suicide. also there's a killer roaming the hospital. then he meets very strange barbara (diana rigg) and falls in love. she wants him to run away with her--but can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one?very strange movie with an oscar winning script by paddy chayefsky. it presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors that is run incompetently. it manages (somehow) to actually make this seem pretty funny. it's not laugh out loud humor--it's very black humor. also the acting is right on target--scott is just great (and oscar nominated) here. you see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. riggs character is more than a little odd but her matter of fact manner works and she's also incredibly beautiful. the script is strong and brutal--but never too much. i think it fumbles the ball at the end with a situation that goes way too over the top--but it's still worth seeing. if this had been done totally seriously it probably would be impossible to take. also look for katherine helmond in a small bit and stockard channing and christopher guest in uncredited bits. i personally had trouble taking this seriously. from what i've heard hospitals were this bad back in the 1970s but not anymore. see it for the acting and script. i give it a 7. Wow. what a wonderful film. the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei,i hope he has more stories in him.the acting is sublime. renying zhou as doggie was amazing -- very natural talent, and xu zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist. the soundtrack was very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong- a family friendly, well acted, well written, well directed, near perfect gem. This show is awesome! i love all the actors! it has great story lines and characters. it is the perfect drama. james caan and josh duhamel have great dialogue. they both can be really funny.i miss vanessa marcil on general hospital, but she's great on here. james lesure is great! he can be hilarious. molly sims plays a dimwit very well. the writing is awesome!they keep up an excellent pace. the show can really leave you hanging, which is one of my favorite elements of a show. i cannot wait until the new season starts. this show makes it to the top ten of all my shows. i hope this show stays on for a really long time. if people know what good is, it will. i never want the show to end. ever. This is one of my favourite kung-fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late 70's. the plot is interesting and twisty, the characters are cool each with their own style - toad, snake, lizard etc. the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh / venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on display from the various characters. i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang cheh's films are the same, most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts. this film is breath of fresh air in comparison. A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen on film, projected. the pixellation created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film. however, since this movie is pretty much unavailable in any format, i suppose you'll have to make do with what you can.anyway, this most excellent artistic endeavor comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us shadow of the vampire. it's a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements (as far as i can glean from the character names) through a process horrifying and surreal. begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the thematic.and visceral describes it. not very much stuff happens in the movie technically, but the levels of emotion it'll put you through are innumerable. the very repetitiveness of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses. the sound editing and score in particular are immaculate, and serve the imagery incredibly well.fans of this film would do well to check out the collections of short films released through other cinema dvd, experiments in terror i, ii, and iii. movies such as these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror resides in the abstract, abject, and non-narrative, rather than in spooky tales of ghosts and axe-murderers.--polarisdib. Strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle-aged man (william h. macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) run by his quietly over-demanding father (donald sutherland) while seeing a shrink (john ritter) and flirting with another patient (neve campbell).talk about a major dilemma, but \"panic\" is a top-notch thriller that looks like \"american beauty\" meets \"the professional\". macy and sutherland are the stand-outs here. remarkable debut for first-time writer/director henry bromell. i'm surprised that this movie didn't get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks. Sure this movie wasn't like. 16 blocks, inside man, an american haunting. etc...but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us.. i found this movie really great and scary.i live exactly where they filmed this movie \"san pedro, california\" and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie.i dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach \"queen mary\" well that boat is haunted. i believe in spirts, illusions, and parallel or however u spell that. is real. everybody's in there own universe.and the mind is a powerful thing.i recommend to watch this movie. it's great, and not bad directing at all.for those who rate it a 1. they don't understand the film. its meaning. its plot, its view. and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us.ty.victor. An unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. tobey maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. the script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. that said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a tv mini-series. still, frederick elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch). worth seeing. This film is great! being a fan of \"the comic strip presents...\" i just knew i would love this film. and love it i do. i finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year. however i was annoyed to find that it had been cut! so i'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version.anyway, the film is about dennis carter (adrian edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (dawn french) by claiming to be a drug dealer. however, dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked! so dennis turns supergrass but the trouble is he doesn't know anything and starts to make up lies and dig himself into an even deeper hole! the irony of all this is that there is drug smuggling going on down in devon.this film is not as funny as i expected but it is still a really good film with some good laughs and a great soundtrack. it also has the best scene ever in a british film (robbie coltrane's walk across the pier set to \"two tribes\" by frankie goes to hollywood.so if you are a fan of \"the comic strip presents...\", of any of the cast members, or a fan of british comedy see it a.s.a.p!!!. \"dead man walking\" is one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen. i find it hard to believe that anyone, after having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the film or its message. tim robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers, but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. i have always known where i stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder *anyone*.sean penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of matthew poncelet, his nomination for an academy award was very well-deserved. even if nicolas cage does a great job in \"leaving las vegas\", i would have been happier if penn had won the award. susan sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the academy award she won. and tim robbins certainly deserves the vote i have given this film: 9/10!. I saw \"the reader\" at a film festival in manhattan this week. it touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. in ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. duncan rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. what i really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. these are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. this is no small feat. haven't we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format, or stage stories that weren't properly adapted to screen? i applaud \"the reader\" for really doing it right, and i encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously. worth every moment!. Von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world. so as viewers we think we watch a \"true\" story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated, often to the point that the movie works disturbing (dancer in the dark) or painful (the idiots/ idioterne). of course the dogme-films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trier).the story is typical for von trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance his relations with everybody else, but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves. the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist. mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to (self-)destruction. (these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark.) the movie is also full of cynical (even humorous) undertones about the role of the germans and americans in post-war germany.as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed: shifting and fading washed-out colors, screen overlays, action on different overlays (with the shooting of the soon-to-be mayor as the most interesting). in this movie we can see how good von trier's handles film as a technical medium. in his later works he seems to step down from this (as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available). Ok, i got the dvd set last week and i am finally getting around to posting my reviews, but i sure liked this sequel in many ways.zombie bloodbath 2: rage of the undead. ok. this one movies at a fast clip, has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style. i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish dv shot flicks that i have bought. most of the time, i get rather angry at dv movies for being boring and looking like soap operas. even a movie like bone sickness that i like, has incredible stretches of dull. not this movie. it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath. although i wouldn't say i liked it better than the first film, i will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films. this one has better gore, the inevitable zombie feeding scenes, scumbag characters, and a few returning actors (although their roles are different) mainly jerry angell as a pretty good psychopath with a killer mullet from hell. the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film. some of it works and some of it doesn't, but i have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to do a larger version of the first film. there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical spillage, just satanism and the occult that brings the undead back to life. so i say kudos to mr. sheets for trying to do something different with this one. i give this film two bloody thumbs up!. *minor spoiler* inhabited isn't scary, but it is creepy. it is an interesting 'little' story with good acting and great special effects makeup.basic plot: a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family's new house and accompanying playhouse on her faerie friends.the movie doesn't waste time getting moving, though the ending could have been more involved.i don't recommend this movie to those expecting/wanting hardcore horror, but i do recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller. The memory of the \"the last hunt\" has stuck with me since i saw it in 1956 when i was 13. it is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives, the environment, and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed. it is as relevant today as in 1956, a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance. to top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent. the memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days. Thre isn't a single scorsese movie i'd place on a list of my favorite movies. but this is the best thing i've run through my dvd player in about five years. scorsese's patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. it's 3 dvd-sides worth of material. it would have to be a british production, since everything about american corporate culture would have trampled the quiet, methodical, no frills, put-the-focus-on-the-content approach that is taken here. and an american production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites. i wish everyone took a page from his love of movies. you should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. not just more \"me-too\" votes for the godfather, etc.. people have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. if they did, movies would be more interesting than they are. scorsese does know what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling, involved speaker on the topic. i really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the last decade.on a negative note, scorsese is best when he's excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when he's didactically teaching you something well-established about film history. and i do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. it's very distracting. Soapdish may go down as one of the single most under-rated movies ever made.a stellar, unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it. while everyone hammed it up, there was no one-upmanship. kline showed wit and great physical comedy, goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking, i could just go on.do not pass this movie by!. Gray can make the english language jump through hoops like none other. he recounts a number of events, tied together by his writing of a manuscript (the \"monster\" of the title), some sad, some uproariously funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic manner. if you liked \"swimming to cambodia\" you will love this one. i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than \"swimming to cambodia\". a real masterpiece. I love this movie! beautifully funny and utterly believable characters. each scene richer and more wonderful than the last. every aspect of this movie is filled with wit and humour and love and depth. a complex and engrossing story, too. this movie is filled with love, humour, and intelligence. totally great!. 10/10 for this film.i'm a british india doctor, currently in india. the word beckham put me off, 'cos i'm a die hard liverpool fan, and personally think that owen is really cool. since liverpool and man utd are rivals, i was dead sure that i wouldn't watch the film.but then i was in delhi to meet some friends, and i had an early morning flight, so i thought, \"what the heck, let's bide time by watching this film\", 'cos it was a late night show.what a moron i was. i should've seen this film the day it was released. i guess using beckham's name was to draw audience attraction (which had back-fired in my case!!!), but then i really can't think of a better title for the film.and nagra, knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and rhys-myers did a superb job.if you hate football, dislike manchester united (or england for that matter), then this is definately the film for you. in fact, i'm just 29 yrs old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid at heart. this film has knocked \"star wars\" off my no.1 position.surprisingly, there aren't very many comments on this film by indian-brits like me. i wonder why?10/10 for this film. I'm guessing that we all, no matter if we are fans of cars, luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road, the noise a 57 chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and, most of all, the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes. i'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination, but any of the above really does rev my engine! there's no denying the importance of transport on cinema. it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema (looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time/space). but the car remains the most popular and most luved, it's even got its own genre: the carsploitation genre. a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars. in effect, it's just porn! car porn! and i'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars. whatever floats your...car, i guess. moving on... whilst running on empty isn't quite as pornographic as vanishing point (richard c. sarafian, 1971) for instance, with its close ups of the car in motion, all it's bumps and curves (!), this doesn't mean that the car isn't the main focus of this film. in fact, the cars themselves become characters (more on that later). they're objectified and fetishised as much as the women, in fact, maybe even more. and holy holy, are these cars something! every car in this film (besides the ones in the background) are simply beautiful  works of art, there's no question about it.as i was saying, these incredible cars are, in a way, given characters themselves. you actually start sympathising with the car! spoiler  most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over. this has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre; the evil 1978 plymouth fury from christine (john carpenter, 1983), satan's custom lincoln mark iii in the car (elliot silverstein, 1977), the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job (peter collinson, 1969) to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug (robert stevenson, 1968) and of course each car from death race 2000 (paul bartel, 1975) and even wacky races (1968-1970) all of which had their own character. ironically however, this emphasis on the car often over takes (!) the human characters! and this is certainly the case with running on empty, in which only one human character (the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight) has any sort of dimension, the rest are very much stock characters. these are all your stereotypical australian 1980s teenagers; big hair, annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours, especially the kylie minouge look-a-like. but who gives a damn? it's all about the cars racing and crashing! that's it! if you don't like that you really are watching the wrong genre.the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film, and the best thing it's got going for it. they are fast; very fast! and we're not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car 'speeding' at around 40mph, and then speed it up. oooh no! not with this film you don't. these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time  no fancy editing tricks here. so, we've got speed. check. what about crashes? check, check, check! whilst there isn't cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers (john landis, 1980) , when cars do crash in this film, they certainly crash! it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and kaboom they're up in flames. it kind of reminded me of thriller: a cruel picture (bo arne vibenius, 1974) in that sense.between these simply awesome scenes (especially the very start and the very end) there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and, in my opinion, fail to add very much to the film. note: more exploding cars needed! however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes  spoiler especially the attempted rape scene.so, all in all, this is a man's film! a boy's film! full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too. i'd recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists (!)  it's a great film which you can just switch your brain off, sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume! i'll give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs  bruuuuum! p.s  amazon are selling this for just over £2  it's a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever. This is an excellent documentary about amália rodrigues. i enjoyed it very much; it's very well put together and very informative. if you want to know who is amália rodrigues. i highly recommend you see this film, \"the art of amália rodrigues\". This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things, parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isn't really made very clear. the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're herded around outside in little yellow jackets. the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory, and talking with his crew as he does so. this is a world of relentless industrialization. it's a relief at least to know these soulless images aren't going to be presented without a human voice, as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry, 'our daily bread.' 'manufactured landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever, with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is. some of these scenes, the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places, might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer sebastião salgado. but this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close. his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold, neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz.all this happens in china, of course, though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh. it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive. there are a good many stills of the photographer's work--or were some of them made by the film crew? it isn't made clear.edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer. we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow. the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted, and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring. he admits himself that he takes no political stand. when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film's cinematographer peter mettler, burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification, and hence falsification. but he is showing us places that, if we look closely, reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.logically, but not entirely fortunately, it is burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites. burtynsky's \"epiphanies\" may have inspired his decades of fine work, but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we're changing the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil, which will run out; that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late, and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel. the interest of 'manufactured landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it. the reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of burtynsky's work and the raw materials, the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully; and to observe scenes from the vast, awesome, daunting, and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china.because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title 'manufactured landscapes' feels insufficiently developed. it even seems a misnomer. new landscapes they are, but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than \"manufactured.\" 'landscapes of waste' or 'wasted landscapes' might be better titles. there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions. Honestly, i was expecting to hate this one, and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it...but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed. a group of college kids and their teacher go on a \"field trip\" to ireland. their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace. the group of post-teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods - but being the stupid b-movie characters that they are - of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one-by-one... first off, there is plenty wrong with evil breed. the acting/dialog is pretty weak, and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson, chasey lain, ginger lynn, and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here - and jenna's role in this production is grossly over-hyped, as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time. even less with chasey, and ginger lynn shows no skin and has the worst irish accent ever. also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film. those gripes aside - there is some good stuff as well. richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on, with greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half (though how she ends up this way isn't shown on-screen)...not bad for the first 5 minutes. the other kill scenes are pretty inventive, including jenna's forced breast implant removal, a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass, a knife through the face, and a few other notables. the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em, so to speak. also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored. the \"creature\" fx are also done competently which definitely helps. overall, evil breed was not nearly as bad as i expected. this one, along with satan's little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low-budget straight-to-video films. i usually steer clear of them as a whole, but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith. evil breed is no masterpiece, but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes - might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it - i know i was, and i'm sure it didn't hurt the experience. 7.5/10. Level one, horror.when i saw this film for the first time at 10, i knew it would give me nightmares. it did. surprisingly, as i recall, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them.level two, psychoanalytic theory.later as an adult, i saw the story for what it was: what if the savage, unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest.level three, pure science fiction.the best way plausibly to realize the plot's \"what if\" is through the science fiction genre. this is pure science fiction, not the \"cowboys in space\" that passes for the genre today.after 43 years, forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films. if planning a remake, skg or lucas, watch out!. Dog days is one of most accurate films i've ever seen describing life in modern cities. it's very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it's very close to reality. isolation, desperation, deep emotional dead ends, problematic affairs, perversion, complexes, madness. all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today. it makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society. the negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly. i only wish it was a lie. unfortunately, it isn't. therefore...10/10. When i watched this movie when i was a kid i didn't understand the premise of hitchcock movies, and dark comedy. now that i'm in my mid 20's it makes a lot more sense.i think the reason i like this movie so much is that the comedy duo of billy crystal and danny devito make for some interesting comedy, both slapstick (the frying pan and car scenes) and verbal (the arguments/conversations over murder and writing).the story revolves around larry donner(crystal), a struggling writer who has his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife margaret (played by a surprisingly radiant kate mulgrew, aka capt. janeway from star trek: voyager).while he shifts between writer's block and teaching creative writing class, he meets with student owen lifts(devito), an aspiring writer and overgrown mama's boy who sadly still acts like a kid. he has toy train tracks, need i say more? think of failure to launch, only matt mcconaughey is short, fat, and bald.owen is stuck in his own life, with a demanding evil mother(anne ramsey) who he can't stand. he seeks larry's advice on how to get out of it, and when he says to go see a hitchcock film owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills larry's wife, he'll return the favor and kill his mom for him. hilarity ensues while the two try to deal with each other's problem. owen goes to extremes to kill margaret while larry, who refuses to agree to do his \"part of the plan\", is driven nuts by owen's mother.throughout the film, larry and owen slowly but surely form a bond of friendship that is rare in dark comedy nowadays. one part of the movie i really loved was where owen shows larry his coin collection, and lets just say its more a sentimental collection than anything.the two main stars aside, the late anne ramsey is hilarious as mama, and deadly with that cane of hers. she's a lot more comedic verbally and physically in this as opposed to her role as mama fratelli from the goonies. so she curses like a sailor and belittles her son at every turn, but thats what makes her character so vivid. she makes her character the kind of person you love to hate.another treat in this movie is the music of jazz great brandford marsalis, who plays larry's neighbor and friend lester. there is a great moment in the movie where he plays jazz for larry, who is depressed and needs some good tunes to relieve the pain. jazz can do that.in closing, i wish billy crystal and danny devito would do another good movie together, but their kinda getting too old for the game i'm sad to say. this is one of those rare movies where both stars shine in their own subtle ways. devito's childish comedy and crystal's sharp wit made this movie for me. 5 star comedy. New york, i love you finally makes it to our shores, but its 10 short stories on love somehow didn't find reason enough to be released over valentine's, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on lunar new year, and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan (no, not the spy next door) and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success. so why fix a formula that hasn't been broken?continuing in concept where paris, je t'aime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise (shanghai will be next, so says the end of the closing credits here), the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but here's hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least.structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in paris.one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. and what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, or as a support to build upon. you can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from irrfan khan to natalie portman (who also had writing and directing duties), rachel bilson (looking quite like bardot) to spielberg's blue eye boy shia labeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date.story wise, like any anthology, you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don't. some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. but these 10 stories plus 1 (because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more \"anything goes\" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (elijah wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone?), or even less adventurous with its narrative style (christopher doyle's, and tom tykwer's starring natalie portman). here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment.minor quibbles aside, i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here, contrary to what many others have felt about it. the short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup. i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here. we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore, i love you, so here's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. otherwise there's always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules. Although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out, this is a total lie. in fact, apart from the opening segment, the film isn't even a horror movie. with its sunken treasure, legions of fish people, and mad scientists, it's a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie. obviously, this film is no work of art, but it's kind of fun to watch... just be warned that the beginning is quite gory. I've seen lonesome dove, dead man's walk, and the streets of laredo, and now the return to lonesome dove. if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove, this'll fill yer belly. great cast, great story. most definitely a close second to lonesome dove. i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection. this is the best, or at least my favorite performance by jon voight. he is captain call. lou gossett jr. playing isom pickett is not somebody i'd mess with, he is a bad ass with perspective. william peterson does a great job as well. rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue. my only problem with this film (and it's really picking nits) is that i had the impression that call wanted to be \"the first man to graze cattle in montana\", and it's obvious that dunnigan had already been there a while. a little inconsistent, but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale. i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper fant and july johnson. i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel. You'll probably never see it, but the uncut version is about 50% better than the one you can buy. put it another way: once you've seen it in its original form, the current version is only half as good.it's still wildly creative and sick, a total success on so many levels. I really enjoyed this movie. britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated. this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you. holly fulfills her dreams just like britney. there are times in everyones' lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are. watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens. i would like to thank britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. she will never know how much that means to me. bravo britney. you are the greatest!!!. The art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current danish cinema! well, at least it is in this movie. nobody in this movie are amused. they are all either annoyed or shocked, and if they aren't yet, they soon will be! it is a story of screw-ups, murder, embarrassment, dignity, and, in the end, love and redemption. the chilling, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and won't appeal to everyone, but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd. you pity the characters from a distance, even as you dislike them up close and personal. but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them, even when they get away with murder.this is, in my judgment, definitely the best danish movie of the last few years.9 out of 10. It is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this. it's truly one of the best acted, most tightly structured films i've ever seen. every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, relating to each of the three main characters differently. the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go. add to this that the slow-burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film. it exposes the romance of movies such as \"titanic\" as the trite cliches they are. if you're looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry, this isn't it. you have to commit yourself to this film. you can't have a conversation while running in and out of the room. this movie demands your attention. treat it with the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot out of it. unless you think \"titanic\" is the greatest film ever. The hip hop rendition of a mos def performance (according to the film's musical credits)...it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each \"snap\" if anyone can tell me someplace this song, \"live wire snap\" by mos def from \"the ground truth\", an undeniable duty to see as the americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of purpose...they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry...\"live wire snap\" by mos def, where can it be founddesperate to find it :medically unable to serve. Caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for. many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see. the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the genre.it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself. an absolute diamond, a film i still have on video to this day. check it out. If (as i just pointed out in the goat) keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law, this langdon short (the last released before he did tramp, tramp, tramp) was based on another comic ploy - being married to a shrewish spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. laurel & hardy did this in several films, as did fields, and chaplin. i have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such nasty women? and there is an interesting sociological side issue - why don't you find female comics married to male counterparts to these shrews? i can't recall any, except in a carol burnett skit, where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get (a kind of mutual sado-masochism, but also reassurance that their not married to a namby-pamby type). as for the fact that the comics do marry shrews, i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve. or do they? ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at him? yeah he went to that convention in sons of the desert that ruined her plans, but he wanted to get some private time - there is nothing suggesting he and stan cheated on their wives. actually he is creamed by mae busch because he lied to her while stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife.here harry's wife (alice ward) is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control. we see harry at his job (it is saturday morning, and the job ends at noon for the rest of the weekend - this was before the idea of a five - day a week, 40 hour a week job in industry). he works in a foundry where he hits red hot metal into shape (an early joke about langdon - he is a small, light man, not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer). he just misses his streetcar trying to give a man a light. he calls home to explain things and gets an earful from the missus for being two minutes late. on the way home harry meets his pal steve (vernon dent) who has met two nice, sweet girls who would just love to have a date. harry is hesitant but agrees to it after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for the hot-dogs for the foursome - he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket). but his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his hidden \"cache\" of coins. he keeps it hidden under the living room rug, and finds it by walking along the edge of the rug. but his wife spies on him, and confiscates all of it. later she overhears him talking to himself and berating her. in contempt she gives him back a dime and says he can treat his date to a soda.but harry has a second cache of coins, and dresses up for the date - and goes out. he and dent are apparently late, and dent blames harry, but harry tries to make it up to him: he produces two prostitutes. they get into a quarrel when dent (wisely) says they are not the type of girls he'd term as \"nice\". eventually the girls do show up and the date begins. but soon harry is hiding in the rumble seat, as his wife drives past in her roadster, and the girls boy friends turn up - angry at their two rivals.the short works well and is amusing, and gives one a better idea of the persona that harry langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic master. he is constantly put upon by others. he misses his streetcar because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light, and in the end the stranger gets his own. the nice girl who is harry's date has a little dog who chases him away. he rests between two cars that both start driving away and he ends up wrapped around a pole. it certainly demonstrates that langdon had his screen persona down pat by the time that he made his features. if only he could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features. In 1242, russia in being invaded by two sides: from the orient by the mongols and from europe side, by the germans teutonic knights of the holy roman empire. the city of novgorod is the last free city in russia. the population, in order to organize the defense of novgorod and the lands of russia, calls the prince aleksandr nevsky, who had defeated the swedish in a previous battle. his successful strategy defeats the germans, after a great battle on a frozen lake. this movie was made in 1938 due to the threaten of the german to russia, in a pre-second world war period. the idea was to make propaganda pro-russia. however, it is an overwhelming, marvelous, stunning powerful masterpiece. it is amazing the combat scene on the frozen lake. the present generation is very accustomed to special effects, like in the `lord of the rings' trilogy, and maybe cannot understand how fantastic is this black and white fight. if the viewer can forget the ideology and watch it as an art, he will certainly be astonished in the end with such a masterpiece. my vote is ten.title (brazil): alexander nevsky. I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly towards the climax yielding a twist that really is hard to take seriously. i think, though, that the build-up to it works rather well. the music, quite menacing and spine-tingling, really provides a spooky aura matching the unforgiving sound of a constant ringing telephone that is driving struggling english actress, joan matlin(jean marsh)bonkers. she's borrowing a pal's nice apartment while attempting to jump-start her career in new york city(..the city buildings outside the window look about as realistic as david letterman's)and is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy telephone which rings quite a bit, followed by loud slams against the wall. searching for answers regarding the one responsible for such disregard towards her sanity, joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant had in fact strangled herself. without help from the manager, joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her such anguish. joan discovers the room empty and the phone with a particular female voice which will haunt her.the episode, i think, is a tour-de-force for jean marsh who is a one woman show. she's the only actress visible and we follow her through the crisis which slowly erodes her, the phone and the banging from that other room causing her much distress which grows into fear. instead of leaving, joan remains, so shaken by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wishes for the phone(..or whoever is ringing)to stop. the episode provides a possible answer as to who is plaguing joan and why. a character named beth comes into the story rather late as joan struggles to find out whose female voice it was across the other line who knew her name on that dreaded phone she discovers in the room across from hers. the fate of beth might just tell the viewer why joan is being traumatized. i think this episode is an exercise in spooks instead of credibility;some didn't particularly like it, but i certainly did. i will admit that the phone, as a physical menace \"crawling\" towards joan is hard to take seriously, not to mention it's attack on her, but i thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this were suitably chilling enough to make up for it. Having set the sitcom world alight with 'father ted' arthur matthews and graham linehan's next creation was a forgotten gem for the bbc called 'hippies' although created by the pair- the six scripts were written by arthur matthews alone.set in london in 1969- ray purbs, a hippy, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. his friends are his flat-mate, the very laid back and cannabis smoking alex, his 'girlfriend' is feminist jill and the none too bright hugo.simon pegg was superb as ray, but he is superb in everything he is in. this sitcom had a feel of 'citizen smith' about it. ray was very much like wolfie smith, trying to beat society, but failing miserably. at last this sitcom is going to be released on dvd in march, i can't wait to buy it. as it was on in 1999 and has yet been repeated on terrestrial television- my memories aren't too good of the sitcom, yet i remember two episodes really clearly, the first being the opener 'protesting hippies' which i thought was a great start- where ray goes on a protest against sandpaper and the other episode was 'hippy dippy hippies' which i think was episode 4, again quite a clear memory about the police. sadly, the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers (i can't think why). the bbc commissioned another series, but arthur matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction. oh well, i can't wait for the dvd.best episode: hippy dippy hippies- series 1 episode 4. Tony hawk underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster, tony hawk pro skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what neversoft and activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting.underground introduced the storymode, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony hawk pro skater fans. another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard, which is nice because now you can actually climb, run, and do all sorts of new things.the levels are good, neversoft also improved on an issue that started with pro skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs. the first two games for the ps1, n64 and dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some. pro skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits. in this version, they shortened those features, there isn't as many people wondering the streets, in fact there are almost none in some levels, and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot.this game does have one con, the storymode is a little short, of course this is neversofts first time doing this with tony hawk pro skater, so that is understandable. however, with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day.overall, a great addition that was very refreshing. Alfred hitchcock's \"saboteur\" (1942) (not to be confused with another hitchcock film, \"sabotage\" made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the master of suspense greatest film. it dose not have the depth of \"vertigo\" (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of \"rebbeca\" (1940) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in \"notorious\" (1946), but what it dose have is thrills, adventure and a nail biting climax. the two leads, admittedly, are quite weak. it is easy to understand why hitchcock wanted gary cooper for the robert cummings role and barbara stanwyck for the role that was taken by priscilla lane. also, the patriotic speeches that cuumming says (that were written by dorothy parker) have dated badly, and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). however, the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing, the climax atop the stature of liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of \"north by northwest\" (1959). the two villains, otto kruger and norman lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the aircraft factory is a superb sequence. this not the best film hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining. I was 9 when i first saw this on tv. on a friday night. i remember the full page ad in the tv guide with the picture of the rex. amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years. anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with boone and keats raging at each other. special effects are no harryhausen but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late night tv. haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable tv. if you do catch it on late night don't be too critical just grab some snacks and enjoy it. it might be cheesy but i thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in the theaters a year before. Crossfire (1947)great message, great symbolism, very good movieit's hard to go totally wrong with robert mitchum, robert young, and robert ryan all together as the three male leads, and with director edward dmytryk pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn. that's reason enough to watch it once and even twice.you might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained (too much) or shown in flashback (also too much) because it's a little complicated without good reason. but it makes sense overall, and we see early on (too early probably) who the culprit is, and even why.besides the drama, well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short quips that make post-war films dramatic, there is the social message, the anti-anti-semitic point of it all. it only borders on preachy once or twice, and it's such an obviously good point to make we watch it being made approvingly and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row. which they do, especially young, who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective, and ryan, who is mean in a believably crude and angry way (ryan is good at that, his typecasting reasonable). mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known acting force, gloria grahame, is a great, brief, presence even if slightly dispensable.though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message, both of which grow in force as we go, it is really easy to watch just for the lighting, camera-work, and acting, including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film, all done with shadows. the archetypes of soldiers presented is very deliberate, and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti-semitism thread. the shell-shocked soldier rendered helpless (but still intrinsically capable), the modest youngster without confidence (but capable, too), and the weary but outwardly able veteran are all there. and of course, the angry, violent soldier who is a product of the war, too. this last is also a responsibility of society--even the army goes all out to make good on the injustices here, not just because they are criminal, but because they stem from the wear and tear of a long awful war.the audience then, more than now, could really get, but it's there to appreciate still. Personally, i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made. it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy. and brando should have won for best actor. anyway, the movie is awesome, the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! do so, and fall in love. This movie is beautiful in all ways. it is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. the acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. ben daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. there is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. it is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience. it isn't a movie for anyone who wants normality. Very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's objectives in flushing out the terrorists.the story is interwoven where two families are adversely affected by the terrorist events.this is one of meryl streep's best roles in years. she plays a cold, calculating, cunning director of the cia who allows these things to go on. she is out of the george bush-dick cheney school of handling the war on terrorism. had her part been expanded, miss streep certainly would have been up for an award at oscar time.jake gyllenhaal is our hero. a cia agent who really can't take what's going on.we have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed, finely paced film.alan arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator. mr. arkin seems to get better with age. This film by friðrik þór, director of children of nature, is powerful. it has great music by sigurrós and good acting. it shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. there are many good jokes but the humor is dark. if that is not a problem then you should see this film. note though this is not a comedy but a drama. Cannibalism, a pair of cinematic references to delicatessen, not only in plot, but in style. cannibalism, a pair of references to the historic case of the uruguayan rugby players that survived in the andes by eating the dead members of their flight to chile. cannibalism, only an excuse the movie uses to delve into the extremes men are willing to go to defeat isolation and obtain social acceptance.the script is extremely creative, and hopefully is going to leave the viewer laughing and wondering... I picked up a dvd at the 1 discount, having no idea what it's about (but at that price i can't resist..) in brief: i was positively surprised.so much that i did quite some research. on the german dvd (part 2 of a series of 3), episodes were recombined into two 85 minute parts, and out of order. here are my results, based on wikipedia's episode list:\"doomsday\" is in my boots + the voice (final episode). \"war of the machines\" is hel & high water (1, 2) + pod listener + juggernaut down.well, what can i say. underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men. i never watched charlie's angels so much, so i can't compare, but the more i watched, the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings. instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. i can imagine feminists have their fun with this, too. all in all, maybe a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure it was :^). This is a superb film and was immediately put in my top ten (trust me i know films!). it's one of the movies that really makes you think, not necessarily about the storyline but about yourself! the film is about a fifteen year old kid (leland fitzgerald)who kills an autistic boy. he is sent to juvenile hall where he meets pearl madison, his teacher. his relationship with pearl slowly grows and eventually pearl decides to write a story on leland and his peers but as he gets closer to finding out lelands motive he learns he must deal with his own issues first.this is a great film and a must see with great music by the pixies and a fantastic score! watch it!. This academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre. told completely without dialogue, it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish, lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open. after a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around, comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl. the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited. as the cat comes very near to the bowl, the fish jumps out. the cat catches the fish, drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy, not knowing what has happened, gets back. this was amazingly filmed with real animals; how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable. i only wish this film were available now for people to see; i only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it has remained unforgettable. As the story in my family goes, my dad, milton raskin, played the piano for the dorsey band. after sinatra joined the band, my dad practiced with him for hours on end. then, at a point in time, my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group (band), and that he should venture off on his own. by that time sinatra had enough credits 'under his belt' to do just that! dorsey never forgave my dad, and the rest, as they say, is history.i have some pictures and records to that effect, and so does berkley university in california.i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say, and his movies never get old . . . thank you frank. To answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the u.s. official mentioned in \"lumumba\", the name of the character is \"mr. carlucci.\" frank carlucci is reported as having been at that time second secretary at the u.s. embassy in the congo. subsequently, among other assignments, he was appointed u.s. ambassador to portugal, deputy director of the central intelligence agency, secretary of defense, and is now the chairman of the carlyle group. it's hardly surprising that carlucci's biographical sketch on his www.carlylegroup.com web site fails to credit his service in the belgian congo. if his name was deliberately censored from the hbo version of \"lumumba\" it may have been to avoid the possibility of hbo's being sued in u.s. courts. carlucci's name, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of \"lumumba\" that i saw recently. in the event, i expect that he would deny any involvement in lumumba's murder.others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film \"lumumba\" treats the parties concerned: lumumba-supporters, other congolese, even belgians. a somewhat more sinister view emerges, i think, from the bbc documentary entitled \"who killed lumumba?\", based on the book \"the murder of lumumba\" by belgian historian ludo de witte. when examined closely, these films demonstrate that the fate of lumumba and the history of the congo is not just a matter of black and white. only lumumba's murderers believe that. Have just seen this film, in australia on satellite. as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding gunmen, well to be absolutely blunt, this film is a prescient gem. a big bravo to all involved. i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods. the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own faltering family, albeit suburb. the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came. although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way.all in all a foreseeing of who and what we are. a most meaningful film and a must see.please note the date of this review. I am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing jimmy page on led zeppelin ii. while i don't play in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been huge. now, nearly 20 years later i finally got to see something more than the not-so-good the song remains the same. again, i have seen so many bands perform, some small - some the current 'masters.' no band, no where, no way has ever been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this dvd. robert plant can be a bit much at times, and you can nearly sense page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics, but that didn't matter i guess - especially for the era. bonham's genius shines more on this dvd then on any album with zeppelin, the band of joy or lord sutch. jpj is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this dvd is how well the four of them perform together. the world loved to imagine that they were into black magic(k) etc. - that was only a matter of interest to page. the magic (notice i say this a lot), is that this dvd captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are actually playing. it didn't matter. a quick breakdown. the first of the two dvd's is where the true magic is. you should be able to sense the power and rawness zep had in their early days. by the end of the second dvd page is struggling with his sanity during the knebworth songs. (it's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin). so, i'd recommend the first disk to any music lover, and the second for the only true zeppelin fan.i may be going too far here for some guitarists, but i would say after watching this, page is certainly more creative and inventive than hendrix. yup, i said it. and if you disagree - watch the dvd. Not having seen the 1936 version of this story, i cannot offer any comparison there. i can, however, state that stephen sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius. only sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right, yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter. if anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see this (and \"dr. strangelove\" as well). when mrs. lovett goes from having the \"worst pies in london\" to a booming business with high acclaim, we aren't talking \"soylent green,\" - but the ingredients are similar. particularly brilliant is the song where mrs. lovett pitches her idea to mr. todd. even in the introductory number, the line \"...they went to their maker impeccably shaved...\" gives a great indication of the premise, the drama, and the comedy to come. outstanding!. What's the best way to start a review of a movie like der todesking? let me start by saying i've just come direct from viewing this movie, and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and i don't think they'll be moving any time soon.it's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it. if not, let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate-budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la \"near dark\", nor is it a low budget, schlocky, \"fun\" b-movie. what it is it low-budget art, put forward in a simple yet poignant way. the idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around, and ending in, suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse. sounds simple right, even boring? it isn't. words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through; it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not.i could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction; maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky. i could point out that some of the sound effects are out-of-sync in a way to rival any fulci movie, but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance.as far as extreme movies go, i've seen the hardest of them, and yet der todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed, despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider \"gratuitous\". in fact, the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale. i won't ruin it, just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise, if not yearn for his end. sure, it's not the best movie ever made, and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish, but in spite of these flaws der todesking is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema. if you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or \"nice\" movies, or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless, this is not what you're looking for. whether you enjoy it or not, it's one you won't forget in a hurry. A surprising rent at a local video store, i was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge oliver stone's \"natural born killers.\" and almost as disturbing. i think it went well with my viewing to be in late 2004 watching the republican machine do it's magic on the majority of america's television viewing populous. it brings up the question \"are we really that manipulative?\" it definitely skewed my view. there was also a larger theological question being provoked- the story of christ. could word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploitive as television produce a messiah? could the story of christ been exaggerated? could it have been completely fabricated? it's something the movie puts in a extremely perceptive light. Its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder \"did kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?\" for instance - is the judge meant to be god or some supreme being ?also irene jacob as in the double life of veronique is outstanding, there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to valentine . . . \"be\". \"saturday afternoon\" is one of harry langdon's best-known short subjects, and with good reason. it is one of his funniest and best films. the plot -- such as it is -- is an old staple: a hen-pecked husband sneaks away for a night out with a his pal and a couple of other girls. it's a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is harry langdon himself. his slow, ineffectual, befuddled, innocent character has somehow floundered his way into a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all people must be ruled with an iron fist, and he is only thrust into cheating on her because he can't say \"no\" to the exhortations of the chummy vernon dent and the cute eyelash-fluttering of the girl. it's a very adult problem to be thrust onto such a helpless, childlike character. harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't do anything about it. in a wonderful bit of comic business, he can't bring himself to blow the new girlfriend kiss goodbye: he slyly pushes the kiss at her underhand and ashamedly wipes off his hand as if to chastise it. the film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two-reelers harry langdon had previously been starring in for mack sennett, with no more plot. perhaps it was even designed to be a two-reeler. this works beautifully, since it gives him as much time as he needs to inject the slow reactions and bewildered glimpses and half-actions where so much of his comedy lives. he's at his best here, and the show is really harry langdon's curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing. his little half- smiles, his look while handling the money he has hidden under the rug, childlike attempts to enter the fight at the end. i think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us, yet at the same time, by allowing us to understand what harry does not (such as the fact that the women he good-heartedly brings to his friend to cheer him after he thinks the date has been blown are in fact whores) he forces his to realize with a little bit of sadness that we are not that innocent anymore. his comedy is just as capable of making us audibly say \"awwww\" as it is making us laugh, often at once. here harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife, he wants to tell his wife whose boss and take some power back in his relationship, he wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the film, but he just can't affect his surroundings that much, and sometimes we all feel like that. the film is perfectly directed by frequent langdon director harry edwards; it moves at a quick pace and never stalls while at the same time making time for and presenting to best effect harry langdon's still, reactive comedy. vernon dent, a frequent foil to langdon, plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective pairing with harry. the gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too, and harry gets his own version of a lloyd or keaton style stunt at the end. here the comedy is not in harry's big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars, but in his slowness to take it in. this is a hilarious film, and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique an talented humorists that i know ever to have existed. Yes, this is one of the great musical movies i grew up with with such great entertainers as frank sinatra and gene kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of kathryn grayson. the music and dancing is superb. i understand frank took lessons from kelly; and there is kelly dancing with jerry mouse, which is quite unique for the time. betty garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with sinatra. she is one of hollywood's great underrated stars. i saw this again on a&e tv and as well have it in my old vcr tapes. never get tired of these old musicals. whatever happened to hollywood??. George c. scott gives his finest and funniest with wonderful drama as well in this paddy chayefsky screenplay. diana rigg is attractive and quite the complicated young woman. this film veers between tragedy and chaos in a new york hospital of the late 60's with staggering consequences. barnard hughes is delightful as always (great stage actor as well).an 8 out of 10. best performance = george c. scott. chayesfsky was a big blow-hard when he put down vanessa redgrave at the 1978 oscar ceremony, but he's a good writer. a truly ensemble cast that works wonders, down to the smallest role. this won best script at oscars and scott was nominated. he should have won for this instead of patton the year before (which he was also brilliant in). seek this out!. I was going to give it an 8, but since you people made 6.5 out of a lot better votes, i had to up my contribution. the river styx was pure genius. sure, woody was his perennial stuff, but at least his role was appropriate. the first half hour was really hilarious, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. the dialog was clever enough, and woody's card tricks at the parties, along with the reaction from the upper crust, were fun to watch. this was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be. and a plus, a little sorcerer's apprentice to go along with it. and of course, did you notice that johansen is getting a bit frumpy? charles dance is always entertaining, as was hugh jackman. Back in the forties, when movies touched on matters not yet admissible in \"polite\" society, they resorted to codes which supposedly floated over the heads of most of the audience while alerting those in the know to just what was up. probably no film of the decade was so freighted with innuendo as the oddly obscure desert fury, set in a small gambling oasis called chuckawalla somewhere in the california desert. proprietress of the purple sage saloon and casino is the astonishing mary astor, in slacks and sporting a cigarette holder; into town drives her handful-of-a-daughter, lizabeth scott, looking, in technicolor, like 20-million bucks. but listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests an older lesbian and her young, restless companion (one can only wonder if a.i. bezzerides' original script made this relationship explicit). even more blatant are john hodiak as a gangster and wendell corey as his insanely jealous torpedo. add burt lancaster as the town sheriff, stir, and sit back. both lancaster and (surprisingly) hodiak fall for scott. it seems, however, that hodiak not only has a past with astor, but had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances. the desert sun heats these ingredients up to a hard boil, with face-slappings aplenty and empurpled exchanges. don't pass up this hothouse melodrama, chock full of creepily exotic blooms, if it comes your way; it's a remarkable movie. This film was an interesting take by hollywood on the novel by of the same name by pearl s. buck. while some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. i found that the white actors playing chinese was not as bad as i expected, that it wasn't the asian equivalent of blackface. back then there were not really any asian actors in america (not even george takei was acting) and rainer did a good job with her part. it wasn't the greatest performance i have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. the locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.i wonder that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.the film had some parallels to the john ford style, but i think the eastern influence affected it as well. if this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. however here he learns his lesson, then wins. Hilarious film. i saw this film at the 2002 sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival, and laughed from start to finish. the acting was subtle but very funny. i'm not entirely certain about \"the real world\" influence, we don't get that here, but the film holds up without the understanding of that show. heather b steals every scene she appears in, most notably when acting with her seldom talkative red co-star. highly recommended. i'd love to see this released on video/dvd some time in the future. Jodie foster, cherie currie (the former lead singer of the seminal all-girl rock group the runaways in her remarkably able acting debut), marilyn kagan, and kandice stroh are uniformly believable, splendid and touching as the titular quartet, who are a tight-knit clique of troubled, fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent, uncaring, self-absorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent san fernando valley, california suburbs. the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex, drugs, alcohol, commitment, and so on at a tender young age when they're not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions. foster, giving one of her most perceptive, affecting and underrated performances to date, is basically the group's den mother who presides over the well-being of both herself and the others; she's especially concerned about the good-hearted, but reckless and self-destructive currie, whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely end.this picture offers a poignant, insightful, often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken, dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbia's neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families: tough, resilient, but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent. adrian (\"fatal attraction,\" \"jacob's ladder\") lyne's direction is both sturdy and observant while gerald ayres' script is somewhat messy and rambling, but overall still accurate in its frank, gritty, unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kid's nerve-wrackingly chaotic, capricious and unpredictable everyday life. leon bijou's soft, dewy, almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence. giorgio moroder arranged the excellent score, which makes particularly effective use of donna summer's elegiac \"on the radio.\" the top-notch cast includes sally kellerman as foster's neurotic, insecure, peevish mother, scott baio as a sweet skateboarder dude, randy quaid as kagan's rich older boyfriend, british 60's pop singer adam faith as foster's feckless, absentee rock promoter father, and lois smith as kagan's smothering, overprotective mother. appearing in brief bits are robert romanus (mike damone \"fast times at richmont high\") as one of foster's morose ex-boyfriends and a gawky, braces-wearing laura dern as an obnoxious party crasher. achingly authentic, engrossing and deeply moving (currie's grim ultimate fate is very heart-breaking), \"foxes\" is quite simply one of the most unsung and under-appreciated teen movies made about early 80's adolescence. I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car \"to get stripped\" deserves whatever happens to them.the guy, wade who \"went to a barbershop and asked for the he-man haircut\" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. that's a little too high-maintenance for me. also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks \"like elton john only gayer,\" but that whole plot goes nowhere! blake was hot,i could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend, who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig (no chihuahaua in her handbag,though but that would have been really precious). i don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways. nick the car thief is the sexiest! one of the best parts is where a football lands by him, and instead of throwing it back, he chucks his cigarette down and it burns the football. see, that's just the kind of guy he is. he has a sister who looks dumb borrowing his white wife-beater. her bra straps are showing for, like 1/2 the movie!mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this. Where was this film when i was a kid? after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather. tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone. grandfather is only \"here\" every third day. moms never really home. the kids always are picking on the poor kid. during a village festival tadashi is chosen the \"kirin rider\" or spiritual champion of the peace and justice. little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world.okay that was the easy part. now comes the hard part, trying to explain the film.this is a great kids film. no this is a great film,flawed, (very flawed?) but a great film none the less. it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero. watching it i felt i was reading a great book, and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book. i loved that the film does not follow a normal path. things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication, one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep. there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it (which is typical miike) certainly its a takashi miike film. that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching, scary and funny all at the same time. no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time, or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next. i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful, that doesn't shy away from being scary, i mean really scary, especially for kids. this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is. this a dark grimms tale with humor. my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world, then i realized who was making the movie. hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images.its also operating on more than one level. the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk. its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters.one of the yokai (spirits) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed. you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do. its a wild concept, but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level. (there are a good many riffs and references to other movies,tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them, though many parents will) and of course there are the monsters. they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between. frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen. its way cool and it works. one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal, it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi's head. (acceptance is also easier if you've ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters) i mentioned flaws, and there are a few. the effects are uneven, some of the sudden turns are a bit odd (even if understandable) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film.. none of them truly hurt the film over all, however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie.i really loved this movie. i'm pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time. (where's the english dub?).see this movie. its a great trip. (besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex). A couple(janet and richard) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp. after camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house. soon, a pair of escaped convicts show up and, after much delaying of the inevitable, they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage.this last house on the left-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made. it's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers. moreover, i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone. i love caged terror. the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty. i found the film to be quite creepy.the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film, which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering. while i didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question, i do think that it will both most people. the acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue, at least in the early scenes. this film takes a little more patience than usual, and it's really not for everyone.in short, this was a good film. not the greatest horror film i've ever seen, but it is certainly a lot of fun. it's not exactly the easiest film to find. it's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough. it's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out. This is a movie that plays to everyone's emotions. we all want a second chance at things. jim morris got one, followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream. what a great message and what a great delivery by this movie. The thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv (ch. 5) during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve. it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through, being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle. the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer. not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time. definitely not a rankin-bass production. This is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate. it has good acting, lots of gore, and a decent plot. one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and pumpkinhead. it's obvious that the budget was not all that big, but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors, which seems to be lacking in a lot of today's big budget special effects-filled films. the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work. there are no wasted scenes, so the film's length is a bit short. in addition, it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would be very interesting as well. so grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one. I know a lot of people don't like this movie, but i just think it is adorable. there's not much i can say, but the movie is a feel-good movie i guess. the songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie, especially as briggitta learns about the do's and don't's of society. if you like musicals, i'd say you'd like this one!. I really truly enjoyed this movie. (which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site!) i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy saturday night. it is funny, poignant, and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others! (fess up ladies, we have all been there!) bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it. (and truly, there is the best \"wedding escape\" that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more guts than anyone i have ever known!) you will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office. (now i have to look around to purchase a copy!). This movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it. we knew it was there- every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. it almost became a joke... \"i know, let's watch throw momma from the train\"... i don't know why it was always turned down, it just was. little did we know what we were missing out on. it still befalls me why it took us so long...i mean it stars danny devito, billy crystal, and ann ramsy (who we referred to as \"the lady from the goonies\"), an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household. but there it sat for nearly ten years. until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longer....it was like finding king tut's tomb...no movie has ever made me laugh so hard, and i doubt any movie ever will. i had to rewind for almost every line because i was still laughing at the line that came before it, and lost ability to hear or pay attention. not just simple laughing, either... the kind of laughing that expends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. the kind of laughing that you cannot control, that causes rolling around and spasms, and tears and snot running down your face because it's just that freakin funny. once i learned the movie by heart i will say this effect has lessened, but i don't think i will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate. i think that's all i can say. i would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't enjoy it please don't let me know, i will probably be offended. Series as a whole - jim henson's best work. john hurt *is* the storyteller. often oscar-caliber screenplays, not surprising when you consider minghella doing the writing. oscar-caliber acting, always.sapsorrow - everybody loves 'the soldier and death,' but something about 'sapsorrow' pushes it an iota higher in my favor. in the first ballroom scene, the costumes, the music - perfection. hurt and the dog typically semi-interact with the story, but this time minghella pushes it up that extra notch in the 'ring' scene between hurt and sapsorrow. the chemistry between characters is especially well-developed, more so than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between straggletag and the prince. seen it? see it again. pay more attention (to those of you who don't fanatically adore this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection). never seen it? i am so, so sorry.luck child - not as sophisticated as sapsorrow, but very clever in its own right. this is a story about irony. irony upon irony, within irony... i love it. every character is acted to perfection, with the exception of the ferryman. he was doing drama; everyone else was doing romantic comedy. i forgive him. this is my favorite of the primarily comedic episodes, 'sapsorrow' and 'the soldier and death' being examples of more dramatic episodes.side note: greek myths. what it lack in minghella subtlety (different writer) it partially makes up for in boldness as it portrays the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than is usual. also check out the jim henson hour if you can get your hands on it. for storyteller adicts, it features the man himself introducing the myths, the lion from 'true bride,' and... no annoying opening theme! half storyteller, half pure, unadulterated muppet wit. A beautiful film about the coming of early silent cinema to china. shadow magic deftly combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between china's ancient traditions and modern western culture in the form of film. an amazing first film by chinese director ann hu. if i correctly understood ms. hu's comments at the 2000 sundance festival, this film was produced as an american film with co-funding by the chinese government, and shot in china. shadow magic reminds me of films like il postino and cinema paradiso - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it has a similar feel. Snakes on a plane was such a well hyped film that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same title in the same year let alone the same week. reading the other comments here i see the results. a lot of people are mad. mad because it doesn't have the best special effects. mad because it doesn't have a star cast. mad because they wanted to see samuel jackson say \"i'm sick of these m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing snakes on this m^*&*&%-er f*^(^%-ing train\"! well, this sure ain't the samuel jackson version. and maybe that's good.snakes on a plane was lost between cop film and horror, a family action film and a bloody gory movie of death. saturday night live performers got laughs while jackson swore enough to make a grandmother cover her ears, and as far as kids go, they would be traumatized by the violence.snakes on a train however knew exactly what it was. this was a cheaply made horror movie on a train. sure it had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with fake rattler sound effects. but never once did it miss a step in its plot or intention where as the \"on a plane\" version was tripping all over itself from the first scene on.i did enjoy the over the top fun that snakes on a plane had to offer and i admit that the \"...on a train\" version was a little dry. but hey, in trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did.for this it gets a 7 out of 10. I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds. but this movie i enjoyed, mostly because i'm used to the usual hk action films. most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line, watch it for the mindless action. and mindless action is right. you get to see jet li jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. it's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon 4. that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped. most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film. but you need to remember most hk film budgets aren't nearly as high as a north american film, and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them. if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing.my rating was an 8. A brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state. so painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment (from the preparation of the gallow to the victim p***ing in his own pants before dying) it has the power to change your mind about death penalty. the whole dekalog originated from this story: the dekalog screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused. Ali g earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. ali g indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. he has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. a human side to ali is revealed during the film, the idea of ali g running for pm is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. the film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. so why didn't i give it ten stars? well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. and in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's ali g for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. ali g's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on imdb. but it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.on the whole, ali g indahouse is hilarious british comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. a great job! 9/10. I shot this movie. i am very proud of the film. it was a great experience which shows up on the screen. halfdan hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. the sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. john york and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story. i feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances. i disagree with some of the other comments that say the acting was not good. watch it and decide for yourself. Good show, very entertaining. good marshal arts acting. good story plot. the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich, to chuck, norris, jennifer tung, and especially a big hand to judson mills. an especially fine tribute to robert urich, in his latter days. a great ! actor who will be truly missed. \"what's his name?\" \"loudon.\" \"loudon what?\" \"clear.\"that gag still gets me, twenty one years after the film was released.i loved the film back then and i love it today. i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day, and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue.madonna plays nikki finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit. when she gets out she decides to seek revenge.griffin dunne (whatever happened to him?), plays an attorney for his fiancée's father (john mcmartin). the future father-in-law asks loudon to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations programme. a seemingly easy task, but there are complications aplenty, some funny dialogue, and some admittedly stupid-but-funny scenes along the way.madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me (hence only 8/10), but on the other hand i can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice.this film shows madonna's comic side (too lacking these days, perhaps), and she genuinely is funny in the role. dunne makes a great foil, while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fiancée.yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more. Q.e.d. was a brilliant tv series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for! i suspect that in this era of tivo and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982. i am eagerly awaiting its availability on dvd!while it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like the wild, wild west, the bearcats and the adventures of brisco county, jr., all of which i am a huge fan of,q.e.d. had a much more intellectual quality to it. it did not suffer for that, however - the dialog was witty and the action was high. the show ran in the uk as mastermind, and it did have something of the bbc feel to it, but with better production values than bbc typically had in that era.i was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially, and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television. i remember my dear mother, however, calling me to remind me that q.e.d. was on, and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. wonderful memories.truly, q.e.d. is a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values today, i would love to see it make a return. Here, on imdb.com i read an opinion, that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed. i do not know if he had better nor worse roles, i'm not his fan, but this one was really exceptional.the other thing - impressive hand of the movie director. i give my respect. the serenity, the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively, i never met such proximity it in any movie before.another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, closest to the original books, and atmosphere in it. and little bit more. i pay my respect to the original grey owl. \"black water\" is a movie that in a way surprised me, and definitely exceeded my original expectations. \"black water\" is truly a very well structured, unpredictable, thrilling, well directed, and well creepy movie. the plot is actually somewhat original, and will definitely keep you intrigued with it. one thing i love about this movie is the direction, because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations. my original expectations of \"black water\" was that it was a crappily made, acted, directed, paced, and boring movie. it really wasn't. well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were i feel they didn't show enough emotions, and there are some lines that feel just so scripted. however i love the direction because all of it's shots seem predictable, but arn't. like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water, and it goes quite, you're like the croc's about to attack. however the croc's attacks are very unpredictable(which was bad for me who doesn't handle films like this all to greatly), and this does make you jump. plus i just love that it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump, but instead the actual movie. i also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees, it made it seem very real, and definitely kept your eyes on the screen. i must say i didn't think the opening 20 so minutes were done well, and i think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life. plus i didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn't. also again i just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic. for example i wouldn't have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it, let alone a killer one. however these problems really arn't that major, and i was still able to enjoy the film. overall as far as movies go, i've seen better, but as far as animal attack horror films(a genre i get easily scarred at) it's one of the better ones you'll see. and sure it's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot. I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. i've seen it 4 more times since. i had never heard of it before and i consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. a true, polished, diamond in the rough.this gem of a movie revolves around jon voight (lead character \"conrack\") as a young schoolteacher assigned to yamacraw island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. at first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home. the heart of the movie is conrack finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. the students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that, only a short time before, had been foreign to them. conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be, oh a little fun! god forbid. learning and fun? together? can't be, or so says the ones in charge. to avoid a spoiler, i shall just say that conrack finds resistance with the boss man....and the ending is truly bittersweet.i am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience, so i should identify with the lead character, pat conroy (aka, conrack, mr. petroy). but i don't, i identify with the black kids. as a kid, i was bussed to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade, circa 1979. these kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then. luckily, in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old, one doesn't understand racism. i just remember we were all being kids, playing 4-square, kickball, hide-and-seek, and running relays.this movie is very moving. there are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end, non-stop. i found myself many times with tears in my eyes, then suddenly laughing out loud. it's a funny movie.\"git away from that winda!!\".... \"sir, if you're prepared to accept crap, i should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap.\"..... \"so, you the white schoolteacher, mr. conrack. my grands love mr. conrack. you a good looking teacher, you a good looking white man.\"..... \"wind 15 mph from the east. small boat warning. small boats beware. big boats ok, don't gotta worry 'bout nothing.\".... \"not a fry cook, but eleanor roosevelt, not a share-cropper, but (something latin)...that's latin..hey wait!\".... \"conrack sing like a frog....i sing good, whatcha talkin' 'bout?!\".it still mystifies me that i still hear nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following. i intend to seek out more reviews, comments, background, and \"making of\" tidbits, if they are out there. what amazes me is the acting given from the untrained kids. one of the kids, mary, i understand was an actress, and you can tell. however, the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions. i wonder how they did it! i'm guessing that conrack and mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or ad-libbed.conrack is a special movie. in my opinion, it is one of the very few movies that are so good and so unknown. others in that category are king rat ('65), dark passage ('47 with bogie and bacall), gods must be crazy ('80), and bad day at black rock ('55). i recommend them all. but first, take a seat in the class of mr. conrack. We start all of our reviews with the following information. my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! so we can see whatever we want whenever we want. the point of this is that critics count for zero. your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me. the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! we never ever listen or read the critics. we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. well enough about that.this movie is very good. not just good but very good. the critics are a bunch of morons. just because there is nudity and language they hated it. it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for. is that not right? every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want. It' just funny, watch it!!! ok they want 10 lines so there: this is a spoof of 50s/70s werewolf movies. lots of satire, some political. feels like an early clouseau movie (probably due to alan arkin), but with less slap stick. if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too (once again less slapstick in this one). actually, the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo (unavoidable in a teen comedy), to really poignant socio-political satire. the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny. the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious. there are tons of (histarical) cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s inflation.anyway, just watch the movie if you get a chance!. The straight story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of america. at one level a slow walk through the heartland, it's kind inhabitants, and amber grain, at another level about growing old and remembering what is important(and actively forgetting what isn't). david lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence. a remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come. Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the chappelle show/charlie murphy, but also to the character daywalker). but i'll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! let's start with the good things! the quote \"strong bloody violence\" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. this is not a movie for kids! or for the faint of hearted! it has blade as a central character (wesley snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. the action scenes are great here too.ok over to the things i didn't like. the overall story is too thin. it's enough as i've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. and a character like blade deserves more (imo). the drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. some characters are underwritten ... that's that! :o). Ingrid bergman (cleo dulaine) has never been so beautiful. gary cooper as \"cleent\" so perfectly cast as a laconic texan who knows this gal is up to no good. when the two lock eyes at the french market, we know this match will be full of sparks. when they stroll in her garden in her restored french quarter house and the love theme plays it is a dream for all us romantics.the costumes are lovely; the set decoration makes you wish the \"quarter\" was just that way. and that saratoga still had that hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping.from edna ferbers novel, the story is of revenge for old wrongs and the fights over who would run the railroads in the early days of that industry.in the saratoga scenes, florence bates as a grand dame steals every scene.but it is the scene of cleo taking on the little lawyer her new orleans relatives have sent to buy her off that is a magic movie moment. after cleo has bested him in the negotiations, he looks at her with longing and says \"may i say - you are very-beautiful\". and cleo with a happy, wicked smile says \"yes, isn't it lucky.\" you want to shout \"yes\"!!!one of my all time favorite romantic films. Terry and june was one of the classic british sitcoms in my opinion. you knew what to expect - and ain't that just so typical! :) unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots, this show is still a breath of fresh air. how lovely not see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family perpetually late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers. and therein is the secret: terry & june was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in stead of today's strained plots with the 'de rigueur' dysfunctional family (made to look hip).personally, i vote the \"bridge to far\" episode as one of the best. in a way, terry's antics reminds me of basil fawlty - both sometimes getting almost impossibly embarrassing!terry & june comes highly recommended. have your tea and biscuits ready!. Rating: 7 out of 10. directed by barbet schroeder. if you like hitchcock's `rope', then you will like this movie. `murder by numbers' stars sandra bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective cassie mayweather. her partner is sam kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by ben chaplin. the teenage killers are high school students richard haywood (ryan gosling) and justin pendleton (michael pitt). these young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.the supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. the movie reminds me of various `hitchcock' movies crossed with the tv show `law and order'. we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't.the other plot in the movie relates to cassie mayweather's past and incarcerated ex-husband. most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but i found this to the most intriguing part of the story.`murder by numbers' is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should i say dangerous, murder mystery. for more thrills and suspense, try `se7en' or hitchcock's `dial m for murder'. This film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre - amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts. average montage scenes, 30-somethings playing teenagers, and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the \"new-wave\" of modern classics. as a viewer, i came away from the film with the same sense of \"shock and awe\" as when i first saw the godfather in 1969. tiffany gardner's startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt judy was deserving of her grammy nomination, which was well documentedly stolen by ricky martin and restless hips. unfortunately, the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original (unlike the godfather series which got better with each installment, and should culminate in 2012 with godfather 4: eat my rage. Maybe i need to have my head examined,but i thought this was a pretty good movie.the cg is not too bad.i have seen worse.the look of the creatures(and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake)was pretty cool.the action scenes involving the snakes was really good,i thought.there are some lapses in logic at times,and the story doesn't always make sense.but for a creature feature,there are a lot worse.a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies,so it's not wholly original.i think the gist of the story is original though.there is a bit of similarity to godzilla(the big budget american version)which liked a lot.i didn't like this movie as much,but i still say it was pretty good.i also liked the music.all in all,i think dragon wars is about a 7/10. Nothing's more enjoyable for me than a who-dun-it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end. and that's precisely what happens in deathtrap, based on a chilling play by ira levin (\"rosemary's baby\").and in it, michael caine and christopher reeve get to do the kind of stunt that caine and laurence olivier pulled off in sleuth--with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever play.but because it's meant to scare you, surprise you, and keep you guessing as to the outcome, it's difficult to write a review about the plot. let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present. michael caine is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably. when a young aspiring writer christopher reeve sends him the manuscript of his play, caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation back.from that point on, it's a matter of fun and games for the audience as ira levin's story unwinds, managing to trump agatha christie for the number of twists.caine and reeve play off each other brilliantly, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that laces drama with humor.summing up: well worth seeing--but not everyone is pleased with the ending. This show is amazing! i love each and every episode. carrie is a spitfire and doug is a lovable and at times a moron. arthur, spence, danny, deacon and carrie's boss add just a nice end touch to the show, tying up all of the funny, pee in your pants moments. in one of the seasons, doug tries to get carrie drunk, because she is nicer when she is drunk. nice husband right? carrie isn't much better, when her boss needs a ips driver to testify in a small case at her job, carrie hesitates, because she views doug as a slob and doesn't want him to embarrass her, so she hires doug's friend instead. wife of the year. but, who i believe to be funniest is yell-at-random arthur. he is drop-dead hilarious, and angry. hey, you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy. this show is hilarious, and if you haven't seen it yet, then you haven't lived!. This was really a \"nightmare\" of a film; i saw it about nine years ago on cable tv and haven't forgotten it since. pixote is a 10-year old boy who lives in the streets of sao paulo (brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends lilica, dito and chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder in order to survive each day...in the first half of the film pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic foster home where he witnesses every kind of abuse from the older inmates and guards to the rest of the kids; one night, lilica's boyfriend is killed after a beating, so pixote and his friends decide to escape during a riot. the rest of the film shows pixote's descent into a criminal life; he doesn't show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, maybe because he knows that good feelings are of no use in the world in which he lives...but there is, however, a gentle scene in the middle of the film; pixote and his friends are at the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the reformatory was there. i thought it was a poetic and melancholy scene in the middle of all these horrible events...the boys are obviously longing not only for their friend, but for a better life. director hector babenco's \"pixote\" is a brave and depressing film that doesn't shy away from showing the harshest reality many people -including myself- tend to ignore or misunderstand. this film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person. While not for everyone, crackerjack is a delight to watch, with tongue planted firmly in cheek. the likeable character of jack simpson, played by mick molloy, is scamming the local \"bowlo\" for free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side, selling the parking space to work colleagues. when the bowling club members need to raise some money to save their club, they call upon jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls.filled with aussie charm, the laconic wit of mick molloy is showing through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his earlier work in radio. perfect aussie casting with bill hunter as jack's bowling mentor stan coombes, john clarke (of the games fame) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowls club owner bernie fowler, with samuel johnson as jack's flatmate dave, and judith lucy as the jaded journalist, nancy.initially, i figured only fans of molloy would like this flick but judging by the number of the blue rinse set exiting the cinema chuckling, this is a film for everyone. I gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10. if it had had just a teensy weensy bit more plot line i would have given it 10.nonetheless it is a highly interesting film.judith ivey, playing a likable old floozy, should have been given the oscar for her performance.emily grace (portraying alice), whom i had never seen before, also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body i think i've ever seen on film.in a beat to heck old car, alice has lit out from the n.e. for florida where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, i'm not sure, and that's my fault, not the film's), and high hopes of going to college, which she and her family can't really afford.she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone, and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it's discovered there's a hole in one of her tires.she is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named sandra and her husband, bill, an older couple who are traveling in an rv.they're going south, to florida, and take her under their wing, but is everyone quite the way they're presenting themselves? flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life. You can't take this movie seriously.....the plot is predictable and trite, the acting often over the top, the dialog laughable; but it all adds up to great fun! three \"career girls\" in the late 1950's find their way to the big city and all the evils and temptations their mothers probably warned them about: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc.then there's amanda farrell (joan crawford) who did succeed professionally, but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door.this movie may have been believable 50 years ago, but now it's just great campy fun! rent/buy it and enjoy. I remember when this nbc mini-series aired when i was in high school. after reading the novel, i thought i'd check out some adaptations. didn't expect much out of a tv mini-series, but now i might have to check out some more. this is actually excellent, and the best possible film version that could be made. writer simon moore, who wrote the teleplay for the original traffic mini-series, upon which the soderberg film was based, came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly: he frames gulliver's adventures as flashbacks, with the actual story beginning as gulliver first returns home (everything having happened on one journey). gulliver, played by cheers' ted danson, is sort of crazy-seeming when his wife, mary steenburgen, welcomes him back into his home. unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor, james fox, who has designs on steenburgen. gulliver seems merely disturbed at first, but when he starts telling stories of tiny people, that's all the evidence fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum. all four of gulliver's travels are related in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time this has been done on film). i love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks. gulliver's small son, whom he has never met before, reminds him of the lilliputians. the doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of the brogdingnagians, and the doctors' scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the laputans and the professors at the academy. finally, when he is put on trial he is reminded of the houyhnhnms and the yahoos. the cast of this thing is amazing, and includes peter o'toole, ned beatty, alfre woodard, john gielgud, kristin scott thomas, omar sharif and warwick davis. the biggest flaw of the mini-series is that the acting is really uneven. you have all these fine actors, but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of l.a. law, but don't do well in a costume drama. ted danson isn't especially great, although he has a few sequences where he excels. it's probably better that he didn't attempt one, but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent. steenburgen is actually pretty good at it, and is quite good overall. another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly. it's not believable that gulliver spent eight years away from home, as is claimed. but, in general, it captures swift's tone and purpose very well, while, with its structure, adding a new emotional level. Just lovely. it is long. no climax. don't wait for anything to happen. great for a rainy day. about a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the greek isles. i saw this in my teens and still love it 20+ years later. i have been unable to find it in video stores however. molly ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place. there are no phones, no tv, boredom, which when hit with quietness like that, the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. and each character does so. susan sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with john cassavetes' character, but he is unable to, well, you know. gina rowlands, is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage. he is demanding and frustrating to everyone. there is another character in the movie, a greek who talks to molly ringwald inappropriately about sex, but things that she is curious about. but he is irritating and horny and i didn't like this character. the locale of the film is what makes this film so so good. it wouldn't work if filmed anywhere else. i recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. Many funny scenes about the people that you don't normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do. lou myers was very funny as half-step wilson. any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non-movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie. I think this still is the best routine. there are some others, like rock's \"bring the pain\", and allen's \"men are pigs\" that are hilarious; \"damon waynes last stand\" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no errors. all the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. just long enough to last 20 years. i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool. not putting in a category with ellen and newhart, but something you can watch if you're bloated. thanks eddie, god bless. I would just like to say, that no matter how low budget the film is, it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies. we don't read that much anymore, instead people want to see movies. having this series out on dvd, has made me want to read the whole series, and want more. please make all 8 movies. please don't change any of the characters either, it ruins the effect. because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters. please make all 8 movies. i want to see the message, and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray. we don't get that enough anymore. awesome job!!!. I couldn't agree more with nomad 7's and i a hvr's comments. a perfect laid back sunday morning movie. the humor is subtle (exact opposite of \"slapstick\" as one misguided commenter noted).but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over. i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previews(hbo maybe?). had never heard of it previously. don't know why it wasn't marketed that well. ?? when dvd's were released en mass, it was one of the first movies i replaced. a great combination of cast and writing. plus, the back drop of montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either (beautiful).it's probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is? if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea. this movie needs your full attention. the humor is mostly in the dialog.i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th. but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off, i'm going to loose it (ed o'neill's face is priceless!). recommended 110%. Spanish director luis buñuel career spanned almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. arguably, his best films were those he made during his exile in mexico - from the late forties to the early 60s. there he had to deal with very cheap budgets, and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences, yet he somehow managed to make interesting, thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time. this movie is based on a novel by spanish author benito perez galdos - and the adaptation is quite faithful, even if the setting is now early 20th century mexico instead of early 20th century spain. the protagonist, nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by christ. the question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible, without incurring in the hostility, incomprehension and mockery of your fellow human beings. as it happens, he suffers a lot of indignities, yet he remains stubborn (until the controversial final shot) to this objective. i think buñuel wanted to show nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) comes out as admirable. in any case, a great film. I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. but to start it off, i got \"spanish judges\" on february i think. it was mention it was the last copy, but as i see, it wasn't back-ordered. but either way, i have it. i thought it was good. i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, matthew lillard (i'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. man, what a good actor.the story it about a con artist known as jack (matthew lillard) who \"claims\" to have merchandises called the spanish judges. if you don't know what spanish judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, i won't even say what they are. i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. he needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, max and jamie (vincent d'onofrio and valeria golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece (mark boone junior). he has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from mars, as she said. so they (mainly jack) call her \"mars girl\". everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. a game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal.there was some over acting in it (matt and valeria, as well as tamara, were not one of them). there were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. some of the score was actually good. the theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. the fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? one more comment on matt: damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man.i know this is a review, but i need to make a correction towards necro, one of the reviewers: valeria golino is not a newcomer. according to this site, she has been acting since 1983. to me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as charlie sheen's italian love interest in both the \"hot shots!\" movies. but good review.although i think it's one of the rare films i've seen and it's really good (which is why i gave it 10 stars above), i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it.8/10. This is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. i am very impressed at the film, not just for the plot and superb acting, but that such a unique movie was made. most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking brit or a mighty battle, but not this. this isn't about this kind of war, its about the war between a man and his position in life, an american spy in germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. when the war is over, campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. going back to america, campell meets nazi supporters as well as nazi haters, providing for interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking. Mel gibson's braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film, but it left a sour taste in the mouth. rob roy, by contrast, is slightly less polished, but a better film by far. this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values, whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale. what makes this film is the cast. liam neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically reprised (in a watered-down fashion) in the phantom menace. the character is heroic, but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover. admirable yet human, he commands the screen. against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including tim roth's cunningham, obnoxious but brilliant, and john hurt's morally bankrupt laird. also to praise is jessica lange, as rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is only as it should be. this is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of its own convictions, and the strong performances make you care. This is a great film.i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this. i had never heard of it or anyone in it (excpet mike from friends).but it is great! eva, lake and paul give amazing performances. the humour is consistently dry and witty.paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends (which works great). the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic (i mean we are not talking 'apocalypse now' here) but the characters are likable, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, production and direction all work well.in all a great feel-good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets.everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this. First saw this half a lifetime ago on a black-and-white tv in a small samoan village and thought it was hilarious. now, having seen it for the second time, so much later, i don't find it hilarious. i don't find anything hilarious anymore. but this is a witty and light-hearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed it.it's 1945 and fred macmurray is a 4f who's dying to get into one of the armed forces. he rubs a lamp in the scrapyard he's managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes. (ho hum, right? but though the introduction is no more than okay, the fantasies are pretty lively.) macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army. poof, and he is marching along with washington's soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting uso where june haver and joan leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are, and lavender wigs. washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy -- red-coating, german-speaking hessians, not brits. the hessians are jammed into a bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the vaterland, \"where the white wine is winier/ and the rhine water's rhinier/ and the bratwurst is mellower/ and the yellow hair is yellower/ and the frauleins are jucier/ and the goose steps are goosier.\" something like that. the characterizations are fabulous, as good as sig rumann's best. otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister hessian general. \"you know, heidelberg, vee are 241 to 1 against you -- but vee are not afraid.\" i can't go on too long with these fantasies but they're all quite funny, and so are the lyrics. when he wishes he were in the navy, macmurray winds up with columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera. \"don't you know that sailing west meant/ a terrifically expensive investment?/ and who do you suppose provides the means/ but isabella, queen of queens.\" when they sight the new world, someone remarks that it looks great. \"i don't care what it looks like,\" mutters columbus, \"but that place is going to be called columbusland.\"anyway, everything is finally straightened out, though the genie by this time is quite drunk, and macmurray winds up in the marine corps with the right girl.i've made it sound too cute, maybe, but it is cute. the kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story. the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story (who are the hessians?) unless they happen to be college graduates, in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say, \"wow! awesome!\". The mother is one of those films that you know is good, maybe even great, but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid - too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in.the story is potentially distasteful in many ways: the death of a character within the first half hour, the december-may romance, the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother, the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something characters, the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives. this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003, but is a throw back to a collection of british (usually made-for-tv) movies from the late 1980's - it has a moral severity that never lets up, which produces an enveloping throbbing angst.the mother is flawless, but that is in part the problem; if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws - inconsistencies of script, some lesser actors - it takes the edge off, but if such a film is so pitch perfect, the experience of watching it is raw and painful. even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer ache; the london in this movie is bright and open, filled with harsh, cutting light.if you are tough as nails, or are one of those super-sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut-wrenching sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the mother. anyone in between, give it a miss, or be prepared to squirm. and be warned: as tough as the movie is from beginning to near-end, the worst is to come.toward the end of the movie, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it (for having slept with her boyfriend), and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her. the mother agrees to this, they both stand up, and - instead of a well primed slap - the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer's blow. argh!!!. \"moonstruck\" is one of the best films ever. i own that film on dvd! the movie deals with a new york widow (cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (danny aiello) angry brother (nicholas cage) who works at a bakery. i'm glad cher won an oscar for that movie. nicholas cage and danny aiello are great, too. the direction from norman jewison (who directed \"fiddler on the roof\") is fantastic. \"moonstruck\" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. a must-see!10/10 stars!. Watching some of the sequences (err, the entire 1/3 of the film devoted to the battle on the ice) in alexander nevsy, a film directed by the russian legend sergei m. eisenstein (co-directed by dmitri vasilyev in his only significant credit), made me realize how much must really go into directing, at least on a scale such as this. if i were a member of an awards group at the time of this film's release i probably would award eisenstein with the director's award of the year, posthumously. it is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film, though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work- battleship potemkin and october- it could have been something he scoffed at at first. but amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come in to the black and white subject matter, it's still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later. lord of the rings fans, meet the films' grandfather, so to speak.to say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it, and often a bad one. it is something that has a full-blown message to it, and a point of view. it's still a matter of hot debate (see the swarms of argument over moore's films for proof), about whether great art can come out of something that is point-blank meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner. in this particular case, the russians against the germans. at the time it was nearing ww2 and russia once again faced the 'german invaders', and it's interesting to note that eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film, as a rallying call for the russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history. the end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing battleship and october, however; if nothing else comes through those films it's that eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together finitely for the viewer, that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail. on those terms alexander nevsky is fearless. but even with the whole idea of 'russia great, germans bad', there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent, a little less strict to these ideals. for example, when we first see the germans in privka, they're not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent (not that they aren't out to take whatever they can). they have their own national pride going too, that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their christian-led masters tell them to. at the least, the evil of the picture has a face, however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in. there's also a brief scene, before the ice-scape battle, where the russian troupe has a joke that's being told and laughed about, and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little. because more often than not in alexander nevsky, with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare, there aren't any complexities to characters, most notably nevsky himself (played in ultra-heroic fashion, only questioning near the start, by nikolai cherkasov) who perhaps has to be this way in eistenstein's intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale. after all, to be looking for naturalism in an eisenstein film is like trying to find non-kosher pig's feet at a deli.but the real reason to see the picture isn't the acting, anyhow, but for the look of the film, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that eisenstein lays out. on the epic scale it's just as ambitious as his 20's films, with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities, of the hundreds of people rolling on through. in fact, i'd say that any director working in hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic, particularly war, would do very well to take a look at this film, even with just the sound off. it's even better if thought of as a silent film, with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times. one could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice, how it starts with the german soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs, and then how eisenstein inter-cuts between close-ups of the actors fighting and then to wide-shots and with sped-up editing. and, of course, one can't discount the power of the music as well, sergei prokofiev delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work. all the while the director's editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed. if this was just a short film, it would surely rank with the greats, much like the odessa stairs sequence.if i did find it a little less than totally magnificent, it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound. while i have yet to see ivan the terrible, my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors, which is really as broad as can be, with the melodrama at such a high-pitch its staggering (the sub-plot of the two soldiers vying for the olga is the best example i can think of). but even this considered, alexander nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore, and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film-making to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to. grade: a. I am a sociologist/anthropologist specializing in the field of symbolic interactionism, and i must say that this film exhibits high quality in the symbolic context throughout the entire film. to anyone who has not yet seen this, i recommend that you also read \"man's search for ultimate meaning\" by victor e. frankl. i think you will be able to draw some amazing correlations.that being said, i would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay, this is not a story about being gay. this is a story about seeking out and finding meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and terror that stand in your way. this is a story of seeking and finding balance and wholeness and happiness. \"if i wanted to dribble, i'd call a nurse.\" \"haven't you had enough?\" ...\"more than enough.\"\"you got me a choo-choo.\"\"if i begin to die, please remove (the cowboy hat) from my head. that is not the way i wish to be remembered.\" some of the wonderfully humorous, and often insightful, quotations from this charming and often insightful film. dudley moore is charming, lovable and rich. sir john gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving...and poor. the two have a non-father/father and son relationship which defines the man whom arthur is to become. will he follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? over twenty-five years, i've returned to this movie, with glee and amusement and joy. it is a movie to return to, time and time again, and remember what is important in life, as short as it is. judge miller. I absolutely adore this movie! i had never heard of it when i saw it at the video store. i saw kathy bates was in it, so i figured it had to have some worth, you know? i watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? then it was the last scene and i found myself aching from smiling so hard. i clicked \"play movie\" and watched the whole thing again. it is without doubt the quirkiest movie i've ever seen. but the more i watch it, the more i love it. it's absurd and crazy and sweet and dear. kathy bates is impeccable, but the rest of the cast is fabulous, too. what odd characters they all are! the midget is just too funny for words. and julie andrews and barry manilow are hysterical. it's just an all around funny, fabulous movie. i get cravings to see it again. whoever is watching it for the first time, please stick it out to the end. it's well worth it!. Arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life far too seriously!!! watch this film for what it is, sit back, relax and have a giggle. the film does not take itself seriously, so neither should we. if you like james belushi, you will like this film. if he is not your cup of tea - give it a miss.i like james belushi, so i liked this film. so simple isn't it?? :-). Very lovely love story between brenda blethyn and alfred molina. the whole story is very bizarre and funny. an undertaker (a. molina) loves a married woman (b.blethyn). they try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village. a scenario of strange situations starts. as good as saving grace and long live ned devine. An excellent story well told by the film maker. the interactions between the man and the leopard brought many questions to the viewers mind about just who was being humane. the humans killed for no reason the animals only to survive. at the end of the movie you were left wondering just who the real \"hero\" of the movie was. a well told story. the human actor did an excellent job but the leopard stole every scene it was in. Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal elders. in every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'end time.' in this movie called \" the last wave \" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. when those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. david burton (richard chamberlain) plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused. although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic aboriginal named chris lee (david gulpilil), burton proceeds to defend the infraction as tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice. the movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. good silent drama. ****. 'doppleganger', ( or 'journey to the far side of the sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late donald james ) and produced by gerry and sylvia anderson, best known for their 'supermarionation' television shows such as 'thunderbirds'.the international space agency eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. the committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. but when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.american astronaut glenn ross ( roy thinnes ) is teamed with british scientist john kane ( ian hendry ). after weeks of gruelling training, the phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. ross survives, but kane is badly injured. a light is seen moving towards them...i will leave the synopsis here. until this point, the film has been gripping, with excellent special effects ( by derek meddings ) and music by anderson's resident composer barry gray ( why it has not been issued on c.d. is a mystery ). but when ross and kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. i think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact gerry & sylvia later did something similar on their 'space: 1999' show. ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to earth - his earth. but why? the new earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.roy thinnes had recently done 'the invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). ian hendry is good as 'kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. several actors went on to appear in the andersons' 'u.f.o.' such as ed bishop and george sewell. blink and you will miss nicholas courtney ( 'the brigadier' from 'dr.who' in a tiny role ). but the acting honours go to the late patrick wymark as 'jason webb', head of eurosec. the character is not far removed from 'sir john wilder', the one he played in a.t.v.'s 'the power game'. webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. herbert lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.like i said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. so the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. with a stronger script, this could have been another 'planet of the apes' or - dare i say it - '2001: a space odyssey'.in anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. we are in the future now and people are still watching 'coronation street' every other night. how disappointing. if a mirror earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. if all the women there look like lynn loring or loni von friedl, i will be on the next flight!. Hi:i heard about lost from a co-worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. well i watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so i tuned it out. after a few years i stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. wow was i surprised. can you say gravity well, damn i got sucked in. the pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward/backs are so so with the lamer characters, but over all good. my favorite characters are ben, locke, jacob, richard alpert, sayid jarrah, sawyer, hurley, daniel faraday, jin & wife, walt, charlie, desmond, and jack's dad. jack and michael definitely are immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. kate 1 step above them, juliet was way more classy than kate. mr. eko way under-rated and on the level of charlie if not more, too bad they both died. the guy dressed in black talking to jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. as a whole great, very layered series: looking for more.regards. This film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity. an artist's profound vision, his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring hosanna, blending his creations with trees, white water dashing against rocks, fields and rain...andy goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive, aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth. he doesn't spare us his occasional frustration, but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature. credit also goes of course to the filmmaker, thomas riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing.if you have any feeling for beauty, nature and art...do not miss this fantastic film!. I'm not a writer or an critic...i'm just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago....and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie!it is not the best or the most.... but it touched my heart...why???i would like to understand it myself...it is easy and accessible..it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it!it is about love and caring, about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff .......look at all the time that we have but we miss it....why a fu*k do we do that???we need to live like were dying ...care about every second and remember:if we do good things-good things come back to us!happiness is real...and it has a special taste in new york...i love this town and the world the we live in!!!!thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes(english is my second language)... Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not just for debra winger's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.there are surreal touches (the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus), but there is also humour, wit and romance. the soundtrack is great also. and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get ~ but with fire and i don't think i'll ever forget dennis quaid (mmmmm dennis quaid), setting his own trailer a rockin' too 'she's a lady' ~ priceless ;)best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ 'once you've had a clown, you never go back!'i love this movie (i just ordered the dvd from the us) and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with legally blond 3 don't put you off ~ give it a try :). I saw this movie five times and never get tired of it. this features traces of the \"giallo\" genre, but also with a vivid italian countryside setting, where ignorance and superstition are deadlier than any serial killer. featuring excellent location (reminiscent sometimes of fellini, sometimes of the taviani brothers), good characterisation and some of the finest genre actors (including the great tomas milian and ida lupino in an unforgettable role), this is not euro-trash, just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation (it recently recieved great acclaim at the paris cinematheque at a double-feature tribute to lucio fulci). Hbo created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job. oz was created by the creators of homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison. this show is what launched the idea of every other hbo original program such as the sopranos, sex and the city, the wire, arliss, deadwood, and six feet under amongst others. oz is the nickname for the oswald state penetentiary, a fictional prison in some us state which is never stated (though with the accents, crime scenes, and racial distribution ny is assumed). the main prison unit looked at on the show is emerald city, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privlages than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named tim mcmanus. overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison.there are about 10 gangs shown on oz. first we have the muslims, a group of blacks who wish to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere. they are led by kareem said a black militant minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the judicial system. as a group they are not so much anti-white but rather anti-injustice. our second group of blacks is the homeboys who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto behaviors up and run the drug trade. their leadership varies mainly because they are always losing members due to violence. in this group, one character who is acted terrifically is simon adebisi. adebisi is an african inmate who is essentially the most frighteningly evil character alive. this gang as a whole gets side help from the irish at times and is always in conflict with the latinos and sicilians for drug distribution purposes. being that oz is mostly black, the homeboys have the most soldiers of any gang inside.the latinos and sicilians, like the homeboys have varying leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show. the sicilians pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets conducted in oz. the latinos make their presence known so that they can at least be coasting well if they are not in control. unlike the homeboys however, these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage. the irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and snakelike ryan o'reily. o'reily always manages to stay in good graces with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants. they are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are.amongst the whiter inmates, we have the bikers and aryans. the bikers are merely a bunch of tattooed drug users who help the aryans out most of the time. the aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of oz. they are led by vern schillinger who is amongst the most racist, sickest, and sadistic characters one will ever see. both gangs control nothing illegal, they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft. we also have the others. the others is a gang of outsider prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other inmate. in this group we see tobias beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison. we also see augustus hill, a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who narrates the show and introduces the audience to every inmate. the character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and augustus lets us know how long they will be in prison. finally amongst gangs, there are the christians and gays. the christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the gays are a bunch of cross-dressers who are often raped by other inmates.this show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison. since language is unedited, we here more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other tv show. augustus hill's commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with oz. this show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted. it explicitly shows drug use and distribution by any means possible, prison rape, murders, fatal stabbings, and general gore than anything anyone else has seen. in my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show ever created but i can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show. if you are at all interested by shows and movies about prison, oz is a must see. I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good saturday night movie. i wasn't expecting anything great, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience. i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised.the dialogue was pitch perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. ash christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see. he could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character. it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again, i didn't know what he would do after tarnation. ashley fink is gem, a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work.there are moments in the film that could have used some work, but all in all not a bad time at the cinema. my friend described it as a gay angus/napoleon dynamite but it's something more than that. it's a character study into what it's like to grow up gay in a small town, the pain is there but the humor behind that pain (that only age can make clearer) is magnified. i look forward to seeing more of ash christian, ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon. One of several musicals about sailors on leave, it is the usual sailor meets girl, complications ensue, sorted out happily kind of plot. it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too. the dialogue is not as zippy as 'top hat' for example and randolph scott seems out of place.there are compensations. it has some of irving berlin's choicest songs including 'let yourself go', 'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance'. it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here. they do a snappy tap dance, a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same film! great versatility and artistry.it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role. she had a varied career, becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie. here she is touching without being sentimental.her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. more tightening up have made the film even better. pretty good though. I'm a next generation person...i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21'st century; the new \"doctor who\" started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or bbc america; from season one we are introduce to a new player rose tyler (billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by christopher eccelson (misspelled last name sorry). these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the world...every now and then they have companions from rose's ex-boyfriend mickey to the now ever present jack harkness (who can now be seen on the spin off \"torchwood\"). from season one to season two the pace is just about right...the stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy.in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (david tennant) continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn't as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening \"companion\" role to martha (played by the very sexy freema agyeman) who helps continue the fight to save mankind...season three now is more on the action/adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and martha is fitting but the attractiveness can be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that she's not rose tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don't really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat.all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can't mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and martha's relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base; i've seen good shows on british tv but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don't have to take my world for it...step into the tardis and join the adventure. Previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than i could. what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.if you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.on a scale of 1 to 10, i'd give it about an 8.75. the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. if you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it's a 10. i definitely think it's a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, 8.75. Julie brown hilariously demolishes madonna's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival madonna's own. cinematography and sets are top notch.kathy griffin and chris elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film. appearances by bobcat goldthwait and wink martindale, as themselves, is an added bonus.it's hard to tell if brown's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease madonna, though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in it.my favorite line: \"why don't you come here (to the phillipines); all they eat is dog and i'm a vegetarian.\". This movie is now appearing on digital tv at least once a month, i've watched it a dozen or more times, and it never ceases to delight me. if it was on tomorrow i'd watch it again. such is the artistry that peter ustinov and maggie smith, two great magicians of the acting profession can create, helped in no small way by the superb supporting trio of karl malden, bob newhart and robert morley. not forgetting others in minor roles.it is a simple tale, simply told, of an ex-con, a lovable embezzler, battling and succeeding with the then \"new age technology\" i.e computers, and finding affection in the process. even if it is a tad (tongue in cheek) implausible, even unbelievable, the characters are not. there is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all no awful method acting which is so prevalent today. a real lesson to modern movie-makers on how to make a great show from, and with, virtually nothing...except outstanding talent. My mom took me to see this movie when it came out around christmas of 1976. i loved it then and i love it now. i know everyone makes fun of barbra's hair in this one, but i think she looks and sounds great! ...and i seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed look at the time! also, the bath tub scene between streisand and kristoferson is just so sexy! the music is great as well. this is the groovy 70's babs at her best!. It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered, but 1969's \"midnight cowboy\" is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. directed by john schlesinger and written by waldo salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960's when american films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. the film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in ang lee's \"brokeback mountain\".the meandering plot follows joe buck, a naive, young texan who decides to move to manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. full of energy but lacking any savvy, he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. he meets a cynical, sickly petty thief named \"ratso\" rizzo, who first sees joe as an easy pawn. the two become dependent on one another, and rizzo begins to manage joe. things come to a head at a psychedelic, drug-infested party where joe finally lands a paying client. meanwhile, rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for florida to seek a better life. this is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic.in his first major role, jon voight is ideally cast as he brings out joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. as rizzo, dustin hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from \"the graduate\" and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to joe. the honesty of their portrayals is complemented by schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the times square district at the time. the director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches. credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. the other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters, including brenda vaccaro as the woman joe meets at the party, sylvia miles as a blowsy matron, john mcgiver as a religious zealot and barnard hughes as a lonely out-of-towner.the two-disc 2006 dvd package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer jerome hellman since unfortunately neither schlesinger nor salt are still living. there are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary, \"after midnight: reflections on a classic 35 years later\", which features comments from hellman, hoffman, voight and others, as well as clips and related archive footage such as voight's screen test; \"controversy and acclaim\", which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'x' rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director, \"celebrating schlesinger\". The effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business (albeit a unique one) all brought to a head by-- or perhaps the catalyst of-- a midlife crisis, are examined in the dark and absorbing drama, `panic,' written and directed by henry bromell, and starring william h. macy and donald sutherland. it's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must, of necessity, at last be resolved.\talex (macy) is tired; he has a loving wife, martha (tracey ullman), a precocious six-year-old son, sammy (david dorfman), a mail order business he runs out of the house, as well as his main source of income, the `family' business he shares with his father, michael (sutherland), and his mother, deidre (barbara bain). but he's empty; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached, putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist, dr. josh parks (john ritter). and to make matters worse (or maybe better, depending upon perspective), in dr. parks' waiting room he meets a young woman, sarah cassidy (neve campbell), whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember. she quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him, as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her. his whole life, it seems, has become a `situation'-- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves. he can deny his age and the fact that he has, indeed, slipped into a genuine midlife crisis, but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own. he's at a crossroads, and he's going to have to decide which way to go. and he's going to have to do it very soon.\tfrom a concept that is intrinsically interesting, bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive, and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what alex is going through. he makes it very clear that there are no simple answers, that in real life there is no easy way out. his characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and, moreover, within any given family unit. the film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny, with irrevocable consequences and effects. when you're growing up, you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet, and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son. and it is at that point that alex finds himself as the story unfolds; ergo, the midlife crisis, or more specifically, the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape. it's a powerful message, succinctly and subtly conveyed by bromell, with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors.\tfor some time, william h. macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business, creating such diverse characters as quiz kid donnie smith in `magnolia,' the shoveler in `mystery men' and jerry lundegaard in `fargo.' and that's just a sampling of his many achievements. at one point in this film, sarah mentions alex's `sad eyes,' and it's a very telling comment, as therein lies the strength of macy's performance here, his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated, believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing. consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed, staring off into the darkness; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling, not only with his immediate situation, but with everything in his life that has brought him, finally, to this point. in that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt, confusion and uncertainty, all of which have been successfully suppressed until now; all the things that have always been at the core of alex's life, only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing, demanding confrontation and resolution. it's a complex character created and delivered by macy with an absolute precision that makes alex truly memorable. it's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate. it's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around.\tsutherland is extremely effective, as well; his michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling. it's frightening, in fact, to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth. this is not some pulp fiction or james bond type villain, but a true personification of evil, hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door, which is what makes it all the more disconcerting. and sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly, with a great performance.\tneve campbell looks the part of sarah, but her performance (as is the usual case with her) seems somewhat pretentious, although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film. if only she would occasionally turn her energies inward, it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters. `panic,' however, is one of her best efforts; a powerful film that, in the end, is a journey well worth taking. 9/10. There's perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart. having just said goodbye to my new fiancée - of oh...one day - for an unknown period of time, i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see.i watched a few movies and tv shows, but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i haven't seen. for that, i have this movie to thank.being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand, i was sure i was going to like it anyway. but i didn't just like it, i loved it.the technical mastery is astounding. how did they do it? how did they capture the animals in the way they did?? it's just wonderful.the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous, it's a happy/sad one. again, it caught me a bit off-guard. as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours! perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what i left.but for those few hours on the plane, i was happy to see something new and original. and that's life. sure, there are those things you love and feel comfortable around...but the great outdoors holds many a mystery. so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open; i'm going to explore it, observe it and embrace it. that's precisely what happens in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this darn good movie/nature doc too. 8/10 p.s. it's two months on from the plane journey. we still don't know when we'll see each other again, but we will. The first time i watched it was when it came out (1994), and the last time i watched it was just before writing this review.. it still makes me laugh my brains out...after all these years,it dose not disappoint. truly the smartest bollywood comedy ever made. this is one indian movie which deserves its place in the imdb top 250. aamir khan and salman khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles. the thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing...the jokes are refreshing and not cheap.. this is one film truly ahead of its time. if you haven't seen it yet go watch it now !!!!!!!!!. Michael bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (the creepy ray wise) at a sprawling, windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young, scheming and seductive stepmother from hell (the yummy clare wren), thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family. an edgy, stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable tv--where i first saw it. it is beautifully written, smartly acted, and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails. i cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it. it is an undiscovered classic. Alfred hitchcock's remake of \"the man who who knew too much,\" is usually not considered to be as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films ever. i prefer it over \"vertigo\" and \"rear window.\"like \"north by northwest,\" it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue. james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family.while the original was good for it's time, it is hard to watch by today's standards. the remake has excellent production quality, an endearing doris day, and a really creepy villain. don't bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over. The united states of leland was an amazing movie. i kept passing it on the guide on my tv not knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit there and get into it. then one morning when i woke up early, i saw that it was just about to start. so i decided to watch it. i had the time and interest to watch it. when i saw that ryan gosling was in the movie and then that he was the main character, i was immediately sucked in and could not move from my couch. the struggle that leland goes through is such an inspiring story. everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts throughout sometime in their life whether it be a small minor detail or something as big as what he's going through. i have to sit and watch the movie again just to catch all the stuff that i may have missed the first time around. as a general comment... i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a gosling fan or anyone who just likes a good movie with a real good story. the fact that there are so many other big stars who all also had great performances is just an added bonus! so do what you can to take the time to check out this movie, i can almost be sure it won't be a waste of time. This movie is one of the many \"kung fu\" action films made in asia in the late '70s - early '80s, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action. but unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy. when workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by manchu bullies, they hire a con-artist (gordon liu) to try to scare them off. when his attempt fails miserably, he cons his way into a shaolin temple to learn to fight for real. but instead of making him a kung-fu student, the master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. well, it turns out that while he's performing these menial tasks (stacking and tying bamboo poles) that he's learning the skills to be a kung-fu expert! it's sort of like in karate kid when mr. miagi teaches daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores- \"wax on, wax off\" et cetera. there's lots of great comedy from beginning to end, and plenty of action at the end when gordon liu once again faces his manchu tormentors. \"this time it's not just tricks- it's the real thing!\" liu declares, proudly thumping his chest. if you like classic kung fu films you don't want to miss this one!. Although i haven't seen it yet, i know that chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about hitler. all great satire is based on going out on an edge. also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. this film seems like it will skirt both sides. like kubrick's dr. strangelove, the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. and hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. another film that does this that comes to my mind is emir kusturica's underground, and fando and lis. so, let me watch the film first. I saw the film twice in the space of one week, both times the at a cinema in orpington, kent, uk. the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. from the start of the film with henry winkler getting 'injured' on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits.for those who love american wrestling this film is a must, but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before. also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head-but!if you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best!. I thought \"the river of souls\" was a very good babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances from martin sheen, tracy scoggins and ian macshane. if this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series.personally, i've always preferred scoggins to christian, although granted jms didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the byron/telepath plot. if you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the \"poorer\" actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid stuff. probably my third favourite of the four movies, but in no means bad at all. Keys to the vip is bs.rob cavaliere vs justin in season two. i went to school with rob cavaliere and adriana doria. you may remember her as the last girl he was \"picking up\". this was when the \"angry girlfriend\" came by, they made out and \"left the club together\". they were good friends at father bressani chs in woodbridge.whether or not rob planned it or they asked him to do it, men should know that what they are seeing is not real and the guys on here are douche bags. especially that episode.one more line to fill space. All in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii), provided you don't take it at all seriously. the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, jfk. (this one may actually be more honest about it, though, as it essentially admits along the way that it's not to be taken as particularly fact-based, but more of a stylishly semi-heroic portrayal.) it's worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today; the ny times review conceded that audiences would \"dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film,\" described the biographical account of custer's life as \"fanciful,\" and pointed out that the presentation of custer's motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts. they could have really gone overboard in building up custer, one supposes, but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, principled and inspirational.flynn and dehavilland, doing their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play off each other so easily at this point, that it's not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here. with a first-time pairing, it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer, but these two make it work. the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together (the greatly underrated michael curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the previous year's similar-themed santa fe trail, it's understandable if he chose to opt out of this one. (they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade - both terrific - so we can't really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh.)raoul walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. the interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well, as does warner bros' outstanding cast of \"usual suspects\" and new faces (greenstreet, gene lockhart, anthony quinn, arthur kennedy, etc). i would have liked it better if kennedy's character had been a bit less standard (i generally like his work), but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle, as he'd only been in films for one year (walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together).various highlights include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of \"garryowen\" as the cavalry theme. the last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. a thoroughly rousing adventure.8 of 10. I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. i would have to say it was worth the effort. however, you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes. if you don't have the staying power, get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights.now to the film, what i say will contain \"spoilers\" and if you don't mind, here goes: alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo. he lives with an older woman called marie. marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex. alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants. the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with. gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her. at this point, alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else. by chance, alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship. veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. marie and veronika struggles for alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot. finally at the end, it's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex's child and alex asked her to marry him. we assume (as aforesaid with gilberte's situation) alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family. there is hope! with the title of \"la maman et la putain\", i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebrun's character of veronika. she was a whore and then she became the mother. hence, the mother and whore is the same person? anyway, what do i know! french films are mostly (not all) very chatty, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes. lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed. not a bad effort. 7/10. Sterling and younger brother try to survive on land, being squeezed by big cattlemen. when 'rogue' brother preston arrives, a moral dilemma ensues. john 'drew' barrymore steals the show as the younger, impressionable brother-barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse. moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax. I remember watching an elizabeth montgomery movie when i was maybe 5 years old (if that) and to this day i can remember this movie (in just bits and pieces). it was the movie i remembered all throughout my life because i was sooo scared. i think i remember the story part of it and the house constantly being dark. the main part that was the most freaky to me was elizabeth walking around the house all dark and then there was someone in the field outside. at the time i thought i was an old witch but the memory of it is now way hazy so i can't really remember who it was but it was someone definitely in a field outside lurking...and that part is what freaked me out the most. i really wish i could see this movie again. if anyone knows how to get a copy please email me at valid908@yahoo.com. When melville's \"pierre; or the ambiguities\" hit bookstores in 1852, his first publication since \"moby dick\" a year earlier, the public response was similar to that found among the imdb reviews of \"pola x\". newspapers even published headlines like: \"melville insane!\" which, of course, he wasn't. but, when one compares the writing styles found in \"moby dick\" and \"pierre,\" one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former. clearly, he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now-forgotten victorian romances that were easily outselling his immortal \"moby dick.\" he was not content, however, to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted, and that surely would have sold. his version of a victorian romance was a twisted, cynical one, perhaps, but brilliant in its synthesis. the alternate title: \"the ambiguities\" is quite appropriate. as pierre searches for, and thinks he finds, truth, we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe. as he searches for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable.\"pola x\" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, set in modern or nearly modern france. though, in some ways, it leaves little to the imagination, and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that melville could only hint at, the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact. the questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask, yet the answers are left to the viewer.i recommend a reading of the novel, which is much shorter than \"moby dick,\" before seeing this movie. i hope more people discover this tantalizing film. I stumbled across this film while channel surfing, and was blown away. it was being broadcast on a lesser known short films program here in australia.it has been a long time since i have been so impressed by a film, especially one so short. the power of the story, the quality of the acting and the stunning cinematography... wow. if it were available, it would make a very worthy addition to my dvd collection.i am undoubtedly impressed, and i will look forward to joshua leonards' next film.an exceptional experience 10/10. Seems to have been made as a vehicle for w.c. fields and carol dempster and they dominate it. fields already has his film character well developed. carol dempster seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of mary pickford, who also worked a long time under d.w. griffith. typical of later griffith films technically.later remade as poppy (the original title) with fields in the same role. Soap opera about a small town married woman (kay francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on broadway. when a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his \"manager\" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but \"experience\" to become a big star. her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. next thing you know she's joined a traveling burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!this film has a pretty interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by kay francis - she just makes this film. also helping here is the well-done acting by minna gombell in her role as a \"getting close to forty\" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends kay. worth seeing, especially for kay francis fans. As an adult, i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen. during the time, i was experiencing familial problems. this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a closeted world. how much peer pressure is too much? i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience. how far might an individual go for social acceptance? who is the \"bad\" crowd? teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions, but ultimately...who is the \"pack leader\" if there must be one? is it the strong? the beautiful? perhaps the person we just all seem to like? could it be the moral character? as far as the movie goes, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me. i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more. It's not a brilliant idea to watch hundstage if you're not 100% sure of your mental stability, because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are. i have to say hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, so the majority of the viewers wouldn't have the level of \"maturity\" to reach in to its delightful side. kind of like tarkovsky films, but different in a way. i, myself, can't say i had a lot of fun watching it. but it's an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the cliché that hollywood offers. hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over. you can't simply sit back and watch it, you'll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film. a film that's similar to this in style is nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better, and way less violent. this one for instance, is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad-tempered. most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film. i give it a 9 because i've seen the multiple-stories-in-one-film phenomenon in another film and it was better. but this one's an outstanding piece on its own. worth watching, but get ready to see something disturbing. This film has special effects which for it's time are very impressive. some if it is easily explainable with the scenes played backwards but the overlay of moving images on an object on film is surprisingly well done given that this film was made more than 94 years ago. Frank horrigan (clint eastwood) is being harassed by mitch leary (john malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught. in the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, \"john kramer\" (tobin bell) from the saw series. through clever planning and influence, frank is able to make the arrest of mendoza (bell).from thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase. malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile. once again showing a different role in this film, he astounds me with his ability to interchange his characters with the next film.i've watch malkovich play in con air as a menacing insanely smart cyrus, in of mice and men as the tragically challenged bunny lover lenny, to name a few. he plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking he can elude his captures.clint eastwood is no one special me. he's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. the characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional.rene russo plays eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than eastwood's.while this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation. you have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end. along the way, you'll be mesmerized by malkovich and eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse. I adored this movie. not only because i am a big fan of moritz bleibtreu, although he is in practically all german movies that count. but also because he is not the main actor. the lead is taken over by barnaby metschurat, who was the only reason to watch 2001's julietta, and who really carries this movie on his shoulders.a family moves from italy to germany seeking \"the german dream\" (this is my own invention and ironic...) of cheap labor in steel and coal industries. however, they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. from this point onward, the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family, giancarlo (bleibtreu) and gigi (metschurat). gigi's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to italy. what follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can become formed by the choices you make.in the end, this movie doesn't say which life (gigi's or giancarlo's) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country, which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration. the fact that director fatih akin's moved to germany from turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy. the icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast, especially metschurat and - this i really need to stress - the little boy who plays young gigi. that kid's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone! great movie, go see it. The paul kersey of death wish 3 is very far removed from the paul kersey of the original film . if you remember the 1974 film then you will remember kersey was a \" conchie \" during the korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . ten years later kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . but i`ll overlook that gaffe because dw3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes . yeah i know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from kersey and the innocent citizens . who needs mayor rudy when you`ve got paul kersey , an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps . paul kersey i salute you sir. Ok, at the beginning it looked like \"shrek\" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. and the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (manny's past, for example). the premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. as i said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. the real letdown is the animation. this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. the humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of cgi before. but don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, \"ice age\" is commendable. and it will gather many fans, i have no doubt. oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing. Othello, the classic shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. i remember studying this story in high school, actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. i mean, when you really do study this story, you could go into so many philosophies on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. lawerance and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness.othello is the big time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter, desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it. othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, cassio, his side man instead of iago, who has stood by othello. due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. still pretending to be othello's best friend, he just mearly hints at othello that desdemona is cheating on him with cassio, never says that they are, just makes othello think that it's happening. othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for desdemona or cassio and iago is more than happy to help him out.othello is an incredible story, i highly recommend that you read it. it's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it, it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel, or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and desdemona, how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him. this is a terrific movie, great acting, good sets, and good direction, this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story.10/10. Suzumiya haruhi no yûutsu (the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya) might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy/drama. well, it's not! the setting just happen to be a school environment. this is a comedy alright, but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm. and the characters does have a psychological sublimeness which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of ingmar bergman. the episodes is aired, as it seems, out of order, i.e. the pilot is in fact episode 11. this makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes. the show is an adaption of nagaru tanigawa's popular novel series about haruhi suzumiya.what about the story then? like in all the episodes does the story revolves haruhi suzumiya, who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking in adventures. haruhi her self has no interest in ordinary humans, and actively searches for aliens, time travelers and espers (persons with supernatural forces). to find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the sos-brigade (save the world by overloading it with fun: haruhi suzumiyas brigade). except for haruhi, the other members of the sos-brigade is kyon. he is the real protagonist of the show. it's trough his point of view that we follow the story. he just happen to sit in front in class when haruhi came up with the idea to form the sos-brigade. he is quite sceptical to most club activities and tags along just to ensure that haruhi don't go to much to the extremes, and he is the only one in the class that haruhi likes to talk with. another member is yuki nagato, which is the \"indispensable silent member\" and is also the only remaining member of the literature club, which room the sos-brigade has occupied in the quest for a free club room. she doesn't mind that the sos-brigade uses her clubroom, as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. she also participate in the brigades activities. mikuru asahina was \"voluntarily arrested\" by haruhi because the club needed a lolita-like mascot for anything suspicious to happen. she often act as the clubs maid. the last member is the always smiling itsuki koizumi, who happens to be the \"mysterious transfer student\" (meaning he transfered two months in to the semester which haruhi finds to qualifies as mysterious).haruhi thinks that all members but kyon are some random picked people in school, but the do indeed have their own interest in her. Seth mcfarlane is a true genius. he has crafted a show that is witty, culturally sharp and just downright hilarious.for those that think its 'offensive' take on social or cultural topics makes no meaningful comment, just causes 'offence', can be pointed to this quote:peter (coming out of the stem cell lab): how long was i in there? // guard: five minutes. // peter: why aren't we funding this?!?why indeed.thanks family guy, for being not only the funniest show on tv (with the possible exception of the much loved, much missed futurama), but for also being pretty clever to boot. I wouldn't say this is a bad movie; in fact it's pretty typical of the type of film that the \"poverty row\" studios were releasing at the time. filmed for monogram, bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community. in this movie, bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides, and, after their demise, injecting bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young. lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film, however, the movie suffers from the ultra-wooden acting of co stars luana walters and tristram coffin. coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case. i've seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and utterly unconvincing. miss walters is only slightly better, but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable. still, the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end! despite the poor acting by some, \"the corpse vanishes\" is an enjoyable movie for all to see. \"back in the day\" is an interesting, but flawed effort. ja rule stars as reggie cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. he meets his old friend j-bone (ving rhames) who tries to force reggie into a life of crime. reggie also falls in love with alica (tatyana ali) who is the preacher's daughter. now he has to choose: love or crime.ja rule does a competent job as reggie. at least he's trying to act. ving rhames is perfect as j-bone. he brings a lot of energy and menace into the role. joe morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self, but he doesn't do much. the same problem for giancarlo esposito as reggie's dad. he needed more screen time. i don't want to say this, but pam grier is pretty awful as mrs. cooper. she overacts every scene and brings the movie down. tia carrere and frank langella are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot.in the end: you should see it for the skilled performances of ving rhames and joe morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing. Personally, i find the movie to be quite a good watch. it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized.not only that, it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads.overall, the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture. nevertheless, the movie stays true to the real world, thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens.i'd recommend this movie to any triad/mafia movie fan. another good watch would be dragon squad. that movie has more guns than this, as in this movie there's more knives than guns (in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun). Seven months since a revelatory viewing of faces, i finally found a rentable dvd copy of cassavetes' first feature. shot on a shoestring in manhattan and in his acting workshop on ad hoc sets, shadows was the culmination of months of improvisational rehearsals, in which the (mostly amateur) actors developed bonds with one another, invented their characters, and polished their techniques to give their filmed performances just the right tenor of spontaneous familiarity. this intimate approach led to some incredibly daring work in facesi.e., seymour cassel cramming his hands down lynn carlin's throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdosejust as the actors' utter conviction here yields blisteringly honest moments like lelia and tony's post-coital assessment of their relationship and ben's revulsion at a black woman's touch as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self-loathing. a homemade production in the best sense, the out-of-sync dubbing and sound recording, and the granular cinematography and up-close camera setups, build an immersive atmosphere that perfectly suits cassavetes' nuanced vision of human relationships as perpetual works in progress, marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and wistful attempts at communication and understanding. charles mingus's largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the film's vision of living by the moment, a mantra by which cassavetes worked and seemingly lived. How do you describe perfection? in-the-mood-for-love! maggie cheung and tony leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre. every scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection, top-notch acting, and the sensual soundtrack. nat king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie. maggie and tony look marvelous, with maggie slinking about in some truly glorious cheongsams and tony always looking dapper. i've seen this movie several times already, and everytime i see it i find something new to rave about. love it!. I will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when. i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it. i was too young to appreciate all of al's subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much later when i was old enough to understand what i was watching. if you are an \"al\" fan, especially of his earlier work, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. it is done in the mtv-esque \"rockumentary\" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) tale of how al got to be where he was in 1985. you will love it if you like his brand of humor and, more importantly, his music. This movie is just a lot of fun. i've seen it a couple of times, but it always has something funny that i remember. the \"duckies and bunnies\" car scene is one of my favorites, and i still quote morone's versions of certain words!there are so many running jokes, that it's amazing. but i love michael keaton anyhow!. At two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles. the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between 'demons', bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse.be prepared: following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement. The first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie, we were watching it for alex winter of \"bill & ted's\" fame. we didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about.by the time the movie was over, we knew that it was love at first sight. this movie, while not completely historically accurate, was and is the best one of its genre. i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion, none of the others can compare. it fibbed a little at certain details, but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story. i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good, but none as captivating as this one.\"haunted summer\" has the qualities of a painting. the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home. the costumes were gorgeous and, despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world, made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself. the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva (where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie) and the serenity that these historical figures found there.this movie shows, besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements, the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well. yes, there were drugs. it was a fairly common practice during that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. and the taking of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was medicinal as well as recreational. shelley suffered from consumption. lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot. it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer. and they were poets during a time when experience was the key. there was no time for prudish caution. passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. and out of the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend: \"frankenstein.\"yes, in this movie, we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin (not married to shelley at that time) played by beautiful and talented alice krige. she is the control factor to all that goes on until she, too, gives in to experience. but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms. as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father.the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played. the music fitting. the direction captured the essence of the summer, as i've read about it. this movie was based on a wonderful book \"haunted summer\" by anne edwards. if you like this movie, read the book. the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story.if you are a person who loves history (even the little inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and the gothic, then this is a movie for you. it shows the birth of the birth of the monster, which even today teaches us about the morals of \"playing god.\"a definite must see movie!. This is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be. it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this. the cheesy acting. the poorly written script. the good ol' boys. the ridiculous, yet somehow obvious, cliché, and banal premise. the riding in pickup trucks with your propped-up wife-corpse. it has it all.you will meet familiar characters: gold-digging hussy, stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own, friends-who-know-better, daddy who knows better but drives son away. and the wife-corpse. propped up. in a pick-up. wow: and the title. several things in our lives have been \"texas tragedies\" since watching this beauty. everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal. A very interesting addition to the scandavian surrealistic collection. recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated. my interpretation of the 'strange' ending would be that andreas' journey ends in hell. he dislikes the bland consumer-led emptiness of purgatory; a sort of 'living' but not progressing, i.e. not getting anywhere - even the city's metro trains don't stop at the stations. it has a metro system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually board those trains. he is unable to reach fragrant, sensory heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination. the old norse version of hell (hades, not hell the terrestrial city) isn't burning hot like the british version, its cold, freezing, the land of niflheim (land of cold and mists). this appears to be where andreas end up, having just failed to access heaven through that tunnel. It's really rather simple. the name of the movie is death bed, the bed that eats. if you are anything like me, you already know if you are going to like this movie. i stumbled across this gem at best buy the other day and picked it up for ten bucks. i got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title, and the box alone.i'm a huge fan of b movies. this is in my opinion one of the greatest b movies i've ever seen. now, it's not for every one.granted, it's not even for most people. as a matter of fact, i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie.for those of you who like b movies though, this film is a diamond in the rough. it has a great premise, a bed... that eat's people. it doesn't walk, it doesn't move, it doesn't have a siren call to attract people. it pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it.i loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the scant weeks i've owned it.like i said, after reading the title of the film, you already know if you'll like it. if you laughed or smiled, then give it a go. it's worth it. Deathtrap is not a whodunit. it's a who gonna do it to who first. it's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so i won't mention anything more about the plot. as far as acting goes it is cris reeves greatest role as clifford, a young playwrite. you really see the range in his acting abilities in this movie from \"exhaling cheeseburgers\" to downright frightening. clifford is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this i have never seen clifford played well on both ends of the spectrum. the actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac. reeves is the only person i have seen who has the character right all the way through. as for michael caine he's.....well he's michael caine. one of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this film as good as he has ever been. This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. it's a short tragic film. although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the \"what happens next\" factor. after watching it, i really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. the acting is amazing. there aren't many lines in the film so their body language, facial expressions, and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene. both franco and miner have that element and it shows. for them (especially franco) to take the time to make this, obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that, i appreciated the film for what it was. also i'm happy i own it so i can share it with other people that would've never known it existed. I love this show. i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again!! i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see's casey his sister to now where he's dating dana.. love this show cant wait until monday night!! also i am so glad that cappie and casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy!!! as for evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale. i just looked it up about the main part of the cast and i am so shocked that casey cartwright(spencer grammar)is kelsey grammar's daughter!!! that just surprises me so much and the other thing that's a huge shocker is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born on my baby brother birth date with my year and i had been watching her the whole entire time and had no clue!!. This story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in. john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece. brilliant performances by the whole cast, but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career.however, as a college student myself, many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme. in a sense that, while they are issues faced on many college campuses, they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe. in some instances, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur. however, aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think. one of the things from this picture i will remember forever, was a quote from lawrence fishburn's character, \"knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power.\" brilliant, just brilliant. I had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer,the end result was just two scenes in the movie. the location was sylvan lake in the black hills. bring the wagon,stop the wagon etc . so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed. the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real. (yes doris, animals were hurt during filming) i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining? a great western/social comment from the 50's. this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for 50's youth. Greetings again from the darkness. director alejandro amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man's struggle to control his destiny. the great javier bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as ramon. his eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind. the dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question posed is , what is love? at every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. the script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room. the supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with ramon's decision. this is a gem and deserves to be seen. I enjoy movies like this for their spirit, no pun intended. its a decent, clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind, and a young fan wishes for them to win, since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him. the spirit shines through in two ways: a funny cast with danny glover and a young joseph gordon-levitt, and the heavenly herald al, taking the dynamic form of christopher lloyd. its an energetic movie. it gets you smiling, and really involves you in the sport. therein lies my gripe. the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team. there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. i just find it odd that i should come away from the movie thinking the angels are a strong, cool team, when really my base loyalty, such as it is, lies with the toronto blue jays. it's interesting, really. if it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay. As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film \"moulin rouge\" and a more recent admirer of jean renoir's film-making, i knew that i'd inevitably watch his \"french cancan\" sooner or later. the movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the moulin rouge nightclub. the impresario danglard (jean gabin) tries to turn montmartre laundress nini (françoise arnoul) into a cancan star, without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress, the belly-dancing lola (maria felix). this is just one of several love triangles in \"french cancan\"--true to stereotype, these french showbiz folk are always falling in love.renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters, and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie. gabin perfectly incarnates the aging french playboy hero. arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers, except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used.\"french cancan\" is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage, etc., only one character, casimir, ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation. the actor who plays him, philippe clay, is fun to watch--a really tall, skinny young man who sings, dances, and does contortions.the movie ends with a long cancan sequence, as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together. the dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in \"moulin rouge\"; in fact, if i have one complaint about \"french cancan,\" it's that the whole thing is a little too technicolor. even when nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song, the lighting is bright and flat, no shadows intruding. yes, the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy; it's just that i can't help thinking that things weren't ever this colorful and innocent in real life. Soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons. but i liked soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what i saw surprised me.first, the art direction is tight and well executed. as far as science fiction backdrops go, soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre. the sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; i didn't love all of their future military style, but i was impressed with the effort. for me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.second, i'm a kurt russell fan. i grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... the barefoot executive and his john carpenter films. soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero. it's not an award winning role, but kurt musters up convincing emotion with very little dialog.third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed. this isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.if you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice. just don't expect the next bladerunner. When this was first aired on masterpiece theatre, it had a profound effect on me. it's beautifully filmed and acted. i immediately read the book by mary webb, and it remains one of my all time favorites. janet mcteer is wonderful as prue, and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene. i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead. i was hoping that with the american success of janet mcteer years later(with tumbleweeds) this film would again become available to us. alas, it has not yet been released on dvd. if anyone out there is listening, please make this available again!. Very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.the script was very good as was the acting. the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film. this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending. i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever. this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good. I've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd. to be honest i really don't know what the problem with it is.it's a decent murder mystery thriller, shown from various points of view, from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers/suspects, including the late porn king, john holmes. please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot - i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis.many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really don't see it. many modern movies were worse - saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings (the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes, afterall).i was enthralled with both halves of the movie - the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict, and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath. the movie has excellent acting, even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality.the soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70's b-side rock and obscure pop, spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights. I first viewed \"they died with there boots on\",about 1970 and though it has been many years since,this film and its impression remain.the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic.when i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some.i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custer,however the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi-documentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set.this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable.yet, there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well.custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of...34.much has been made of custer's final class ranking,but of the 68 cadets who entered the military academy with him in 1857,half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day,june 24,1861.it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident\"his squadron would follow him to hell,\"your at attention sargeant,reprimands tape.if iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attaché to not only sheridan,but hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellan.there is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack ,\"young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederates.as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels,custers audacity shone through.he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers,including a rebel captain.yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomac.this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise.\"robert l.bateman-armchair general.there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custer,the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes.though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the \"little big horn\" only a few feet from where george custer was to die as well.they were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military career.the list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officer.he was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the means,and the information(discovered wrapped around some cigars was general lee's plans to split his forces)and yet he failed to act for some 17 hours.it can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result. custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburg,pa.his forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some 6,000 rebels with but a force of 2,300.i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussion.there is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder, well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regiments.though custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe.the truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank.this action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success.it was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and best.his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it. This is a great film - esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today's politically-minded filmmakers. a film that can so easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity these days. while the bouyant optimism of the 1960's can't be regained, i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film's breezy energy and charm. i don't know what those who label the film \"boring\" were watching - there's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time. This is a warm, funny film, in much the same vein as the works of almodovar. sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts, but the style is so playful that i can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted (but would i be willing to let my 10-year old son play the part? not so sure!). spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink. i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude, we'd be much better off as a result.this liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'fartman maurice' character. as his lover says to him: 'most people are embarrassed about farting. you turn it into an art form.'. What can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters? the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together. it's simple and really efficient. the background story is less important. why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller? it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film-jerkers like to make. not too much ambition, right: sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization.for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy. it goes quite as easy as in rear window (an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less compelling context. where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. he brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before. jacques audiard is not a new-comer yet. strange and weird. This columbo is unique in that we don't really know the exact outcome until the very end. our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle; each points the finger at his brother. in a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice, and this was columbo's time. other than that wrinkle, this episode fits in well with others of the series. it has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny performance by jeanette nolan as the fastidious and loyal housekeeper who takes an instant dislike to columbo. \"they both believed that a hidden sentiment has unified them. this certitude is beautiful,but the incertitude is more beautiful. they believed that they had never been met.nothing has happened between them.but those roads,those stairs,those corridors for all that time they could have been met.\" although it did not mean to be,it was a swan song.two young people,who are neighbors and have never been met,are found in the same places,the same times,doing most of the times the same things.they finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together.meanwhile the woman has met an old man.their relation is brotherhood-like.he told her his life.it was like the young one's but with better prospectives.the young man can do whatever the old man has not lived.he can be happy with the woman. the ending is exceptional.there is a ship wreck.the only survivors are the heros of the \"three colors\".the man and the woman finally meet.the scene lasts a few seconds.the woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film;sad in a red fond.\"but every start is only the continue.the book of the life is opened in the middle.\". This tv adaptation of sarah waters' novel was so lovingly done i can hardly find the words to appreciate it. not since \"tipping the velvet\" (also highly recommended) have i seen such a performance by the lead actresses, this time by sally hawkins and elaine cassidy. they acted with their souls, and this is what gets across to the audience! the supporting actors were well chosen, too, they made a great ensemble.for those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship - no, this is only one part. the other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. and the plot has some further surprising twists. so the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well. I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. i was busting for the loo; and i didn't even want to pause it because i was drawn right in. emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. it gives you an amazing insight to south africa; their struggles and their lives. the acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; i was captivated. i don't want to even try and explain the story; it's way too complex and i wouldn't do it justice. please see this; you'll understand why when you do. cheers, hol. My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. \"they're laserdiscs of flash gordon serials,\" he says. \"i'm gonna have some giant coasters,\" i say. but not so. this serial rocks. (but i had to whine & moan to almost everyone i knew to find a laserdisc player for em).there is really a little of everything in this serial: there are lion-men, hawk-men, shark-men, earthmen, & i guess you'd call em mongo-men. the sets & costumes combine, greek, roman, oriental, egyptian and there's even armour like english knights. awesome costumes. and some of it was a riot. those horrible tights with shorts over em worn by zarkov are beyond description. and the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers.it's also funny the way they renamed the octopus to an octosack, the orangutan to orangapoid, and the tiger to a tigron. there's even a dragon (a godzilla-like creature who threatens flash on a couple of occasions before being killed off).you like the invisible man? this has got you covered. you like sword fights, wrestling (both animals & men), fist fights? plenty for any taste. we have an underwater city, a sky city, a city on top of a mountain, and tonnes of secret passages and caves.hokey effects? massive amounts. the sky city is supported by radium furnaces stoked like old-time steamships. the rocketships are \"powered\" by fireworks and have constant backfires and/or humming noises. lots of wires are visible holding things up (like food when flash was invisible and of course rocketships). there's clouds out in space, but none around the earth when viewed from mongo. \"giant\" lizards show up briefly. fighting sea creatures supposedly threaten flash & co. on the way to the shark-men's underwater city. the \"gadgets\" in dr. zarkov's lab crack me up. and they seem to be the same ones no matter what lab he's in (he worked in ming's lab and vultan's).and yeah, we have romance. everyone wants dale; ming, vultan, flash. but at least one person wanted princess aura (prince baron) just not the person she would have preferred. in fact, it seems a lot of the sub-plots concern intrigue on the part of princess aura to try to win flash.man i think the characters are awesome. that fat, horse-laughing, king vultan was hilarious. how he managed those wings was pure artistry. and ming! what can i say about ming? he was perfect. they should have had him for the emperor in starwars. ming has got to be my favourite character in this serial. princess aura was quite a little character too. and she pulled it off nicely. i think she's a better actress than dale arden by a long shot. even the sneaky high priest had a distinctive role. zarkov was good, but not the strongest character---and he always stood in the background during fight scenes holding dale. now we get to flash: flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero---and he did it well. crabbe is a good actor and this role fit him perfectly.after watching this, i think i know where george lucas got the main idea for starwars. watch this, you'll see what i mean.if you ever considered watching an old serial (or any serial for that matter), this should be your first choice. the only reason i didn't give this one a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been fixed easily, the way the giant lizards seemed just tacked in there, and a couple of weak characters (king of shark-men & king of lion-men). This is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's! i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music. anyway, i love the way the blob looks. i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party. another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night, just like halloween ii.when steve and jane are making out, they see a meteor fall from space. inside the meteor is the blob. whenever the blob consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. can anything stop this blobby creature? i highly recommend the blob!!!. The beaver trilogy is, without a doubt, one of the most brilliant films ever made. i was lucky enough to catch it, along with a q&a session with director trent harris, at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trent's website. this movie has to be seen to be believed! i sincerely recommend searching for trent's name on the web and then buying the film from his site. he's an incredibly nice guy to boot. don't get confused: the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trent!after having seen the trilogy a few times, i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version. it's like a try-out version for the crispin glover \"orkly kid\" section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you're a penn fan than it being a good video. penn is pretty funny, though, and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty b&w video.this is probably also one of crispin glover's best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin' gary. once you see this film, you'll never get gary's nervous laughter out of your head ever again. Lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques. some of them are very original while others are best forgotten.he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey. with so many cities lying in ruins, leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration. it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line. his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers. when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles. a terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished. there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details.the railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations. in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half-starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz . these images, horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected.at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb. in view of many by-standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage. he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock. later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank. looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock. if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task. quite ridiculous in fact. it could only happen in a dream.it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train.despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, i prefer lars von trier's later films (breaking the waves and the idiots). the bomb scene described above really put me off. perhaps i'm a realist. Getting to work on this film when it was made back in the summer of 1990. shot partly in the biltmore estate in asheville, nc and the remaining parts in winston-salem. the massive offices of the rj reynolds were used in several office scenes and places in around the beautiful city that is know as the tulip capital of the world winston-salem! i enjoyed my work although it was exceedingly hard work building all the sets like the golf of mexico where renee russo and jim belushi went on their date. i also had a big hand in decorating the bar where larry encounters the magical bartender mr. destiny. i tacked all those pics on the wall of sports heroes and decorated that phone booth where larry makes a phone call for a cab. i even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it. i remember dyeing the grass at his old house with green dye because it first had to be sodded(it was a new house in a new development and i guess they leased it for the movie)..then i had to cut that newly laid sod to make it look nice..man that was hard! as far as the movie, when we made it we had no idea what it would be like but after seeing it i fell in love with it because really tells the story of \"what if\" as good as i ever had seen it, including the great it's a wonderful life. i cried so many timesi can't count. i got to meet the wonderful actor michael caine while shooting scenes at an old minor league ballpark where larry's boyhood scenes were played and replayed. i remember after he had done a take an was heading back to his trailer, i ran him down and asked him for a picture and he was quite amiable and said \"why not!\" he is a good guy and a really natural and forceful actor. i can't say the same for jim belushi..he was so full of himself, smoking big cuban cigars and talking loudly soeveryone in earshot could hear his every word. his career never did take off but he has had a decent tv career recently. i would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance. it's wonderful and really heartfelt and real. you can feel larry's pain after he enters into the new world mr. destiny gives him after hitting the homer, and as he wants so badly for people to believe he is not this bad guy everyone thinks he is. they all think he belongs in a nuthouse! but eventually he wins people over but by then he wants his real life back so badly, especially his wonderful wife, played so beautifully by linda hamilton..and he wants his dog back! so see it. I was amazingly impressed by this movie. it contained fundamental elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and companionship. it wasn't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music. he finds a companion who comes with her own issues. claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst. des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star. yet he has musical genius. he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate, while things around him literally go to ruins. his focus is creating his whale music, in fact it becomes an obsession for him.claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay. she finds hidden talents while being in des company. she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her. she learns to trust him over a period of time.these two find love with one another. not the mind blowing, sex infused kind of passion, but a love where friendship and understanding means more. for two people who have been hurt, they find trust together. Hello again, i have been thinking about this movie all my life. i saw it when i was 5 years old in los angeles, california in 1942. what a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness, and charity. you forget it is the bugs relating to one another. it was just as if they were people. i love this movie and so do my adult children. such beautiful color in this movie.i need to see this movie again. there is a story about an envelope in the movie, that i just can't remember the \"why\" of it.thanks for listening. This is one of the best films made about the 80 punk scene. i saw this a few years back on a \"bootleg\" copy and was amazed. very few of todays kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80s punk legends such as the germs and shows how it was back then. nowadays so much punk has gone mainstream with mtv and radio and its nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene. darby crash (of the germs) is one of my heros and this film shows why. a must see for all \"punks\" and anyone curious about the 80s punk scene. This one is out there. not much to say about it except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in films of beastiality. i can see why this film was banned for so long, the topics dealt within the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits in with the mood of the film. it's a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose ...to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we don't see to often in films. i came across this film on the net that i thought i might check out. i enjoyed the film as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time. something you don't rarely see in films today. I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ visual pleasure:[100%] this is extremely pleasing movie visually. i had a great time watching it. golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing. i also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag.director's work:[70%] bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows he's got talent. did a decent job.acting:[90%] shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis ouimet(this guy can act well). the rest of the cast was also good.entertainment value:[100%] i enjoyed every minute of it. it was overwhelmingly entertaining.script:[91%] based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special. it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end.__________________________________________________________________ my advice: definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golf(you all will love it). anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesn't hate sports can watch it. _____ 10/10. \"hitler, the rise of evil\" is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war 2. which makes watching a refreshing experience.i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi-mechanism. of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top. having arrived there, this film ends.when on top, the 'fuhrer' (= german for 'leader') led his germany to the biggest & most devastating war in history of mankind. ending six years later in germany's utter defeat. as a result, germany lost its eastern provinces (= about 35% of its prewar soil), and was forced to accept a 44 year-split of its remaining territory. both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, their reputations severely damaged by the many nazi-atrocities inspired by racism.as i said, \"hitler, the rise of evil\" makes an good watch. set in an acceptable thirties-environment, with (more than) competent acting. in particular peter o'toole's role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out, even adds an extra dimension.my copy of \"hitler, the rise of evil\" also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films. one is about hitler's personality, the second deals with the forgery of the hitler-diaries. in 1983 this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany, damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists. Sometimes, you're up late at night flipping through the stations, bored out of your mind, and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. and this movie fit that exact billing. sure, the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s....the writing as schmaltzy as the hallmark greeting card company's legendary poetry, and the one- dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked straight from central casting - but it was cute, and exactly what i needed last night. lauren holly and costas mandylor have great chemistry together - i liked it on \"picket fences,\" and i'm happy to say they still have it over 10 year later. costas mandylor, at 41, is still possibly one of the handsomest men to grace the screens since ol' rudy valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago. rrrowrr! bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller skates on that show about the cartoon lady. i always thought he was something straight out of a hepburn-grant comedy. bravo!some people will probably say this was the corniest piece of cinema ever made, and i would probably have to agree - but come on! it's on the hallmark channel. what were you expecting? just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks, and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of zinfandel. trust me, you'll love and accept the schmaltz a whole lot more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming about costas mandylor swimming in a sea of tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with minty fresh chocolate icing. yummo! (ps. now i have a hankering for petit fours. thanks a lot, hallmark!)i really wish the evil girl had been cast with rachel ray, and maybe that dishy food nerd alton brown as the announcer instead of the creepy dude with the van dyk beard. shudder! that would have made my night. but hey, check out \"just desserts.\". After 'aakrosh' , this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director.till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india.this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence. it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released. this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'coolie', 'betaab','hero' in 1983.smithapatel, in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him. she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs.at one time,she even gave up her love when the hero's ruthlessness touched the roof top.there was another character in this movie, which was played by om puri contemporary, naseeruddin shah.he played as an inspector-turned-alcoholic character.the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero's ending.in his debut film,sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare.the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent. the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani's other film \"drohkaal\". even after two decades, this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew. each one played their part par excellence. This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre. i was happy to see william powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm, and without the silly attitude of his nick charles character (from the \"thin man\" series). while the story is good on its own, i think what really makes this movie fun to watch is michael curtiz' fantastically imaginative direction. from a visual point of view, this is a richly textured movie, with curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium; from split screen images, to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks, curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best hollywood directors. highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie. A delightfully unpretentious send up of romeo and juliet. approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one. a talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light-hearted performers' vehicle. bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of shakespeare. some people feel that all film must be \"important\" ---if you share those views, don't bother. the credits read \"introducing\" angelina jolie, which is not even close to being true, but she is astoundingly beautiful as the juliet character, and, as always, her acting is wonderful--- and, considering her age at the time, even her dialect is pretty good. recreating this classic tale with feuding italian families in the catering business in new york results in great fun. see it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud. I'm glad cage changed his name from coppolla and got this part on his own. light-hearted, no deep thought needed, but a cute piece about opposites attracting- though her parents are still hippies.... captures the voice of the early 80's- the whine of the valley and the funk of the other side. one can see the beginning of cage's talent. As i have matured, my fascination with the academy awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement. as in a few other comments that i have written, the bizarre results of academy award voting are often difficult to explain. the omission of \"in cold blood\" in 1967 as one of the five best picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable \"dr. dolittle.\" while only an insomniac or masochist would tune in to that rex harrison disaster, richard brook's powerful adaptation of truman capotes non-fiction novel retains its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely drained by the final fade out. while there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material. based on a nebraska multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place, \"in cold blood\" was filmed by master cinematographer conrad hall in stark black and white, and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio. together with quincy jones's unsettling score, hall's work should have been credited above the title with brook's screenplay as the three pillars on which this intense classic is built. the performances are fine as well. scott wilson is all cold charm and robert blake intense introversion as the two killers. (there is an inside joke at one point when blake speaks of bogart and \"the treasure of the sierra madre\" while the duo are driving to mexico. as a child star, blake sold the lottery ticket to bogart in that john huston film.) the film, like the book, is definitely slanted towards the killers and has an anti-capital punishment tilt, although the remorselessness of the murderers somewhat negates that sentiment despite the difficult-to-watch final scenes. some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals, their backgrounds, and lives, while the clutter family, which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night, come across as one-dimensional characters of little import. this lack of balance comes from the book as capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row. the clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth. however, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, \"in cold blood\" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts. run a double bill with \"dead man walking,\" and you may not speak for days. William wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss hart's hit broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: george cukor. the \"women's director\" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of air corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled chinese-american recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring. notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: lon mcallister, edmond o'brien, martin ritt, red buttons (in drag, as an andrews sister), peter lind hayes, karl malden, kevin mccarthy, gary merrill, lee j. cobb, and don taylor. also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as o'brien's worried-sick brooklyn spouse. too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after twentieth century fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon. it's disingenuous and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more widely seen. Although cameron grant was clearly hired to replace andrew blake over at ultimate pictures when the latter started his own company (studio a), he practically outdid the \"master\" right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes. so, while all the window dressing blake had pioneered (starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses, coiffed and made up as if they're about to hit the catwalk) remained very much present and accounted for, grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content. in doing so, he raised the heat to a level that had eluded big a ever since his first  and imho best  film night trips. cam's maiden effort, elements of desire, might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the blake aesthetic (with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes), but his subsequent dinner party already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece.the title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories, with an extended orgy at the conclusion. scrumptious juli ashton and tammy parks smear food stuff all over each other's flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh. busty crystal gold (here : \"catalina\") was rarely more than a reliable second-stringer, adding spice to several ona zee bargain basement noirs, yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with fabio lookalike vince voyeur. beautiful blondes kylie ireland and yvonne, making out with marc davis (for the record, the latter two were an item at the time) under a waterfall, complete the eye candy section of the movie.time to get cooking ! early jenna jameson (\"daisy\" back then) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains frank towers (\"mark slade\" on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry) of all vital juices, albeit with a little help from brunette diva for effective contrast, the scene's stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place. impossibly hunky construction worker gerry pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down, a prospect too tantalizing for prim 'n' proper business woman asia carrera (at her all time most achingly pretty) to pass up. best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty norma jeane and handsome sean michaels teasing the pants off each other  for starters !  while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion.with sex that proves either artsy or hot, and more often than not both, grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film's gastronomic analogy the title implies. couples may be the prime intended audience, but an alternation between naughty 'n' nice should rightfully include that \"something for everything\" recipe so many adult features are aiming for. acting as his own dop, the director shows great eye for detail, like the shot of asia carrera's pristine white shoes being spattered with mud, enriching his vision. this marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one, as was the case with nick steele who stepped up to take his place at ultimate  effectively making him a replacement's replacement ?  when he packed up for greener pastures. Why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie???!!! the cast gives some good performance (elizabeth berkley as a barbie girl, ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin, a guy eternally lessened by his bother), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original. i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! julie corman (the producer): are you crazy???!!!. I have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks, and was thrilled when i discovered this gem. i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene, and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938. i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone's time. First they came for the communists, and i didn't speak up, because i wasn't a communist. then they came for the jews, and i didn't speak up, because i wasn't a jew. then they came for the catholics, and i didn't speak up, because i was a protestant. then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.attributed to rev. martin niemoller, 1945when faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn. but when does enough become too much? global anti-semitic sentiments allowed hitler's genocidal policies to thrive, and equal doses of fear-mongering and ignorance made it possible for the anti-communist purges of mccarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples' lives. inaction makes one no less culpable.lawrence newman is a chameleon of a man: quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings. lawrence doesn't like to get involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he tells no one and goes about his business. his world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses, and is mistaken for one of \"them.\" lawrence's view of the world and its view of him is forever altered. while the subject matter of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. it is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice, when placed within a certain context - lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is jewish, than he is with the views of his attackers. he believes that if he corrects this \"oversight\" that everything will be all right, not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. whether playing a schemer (the only thing i liked about \"fargo\") or a down home nice guy sheriff, william h. macy's roles are linked by a common thread -his characters share a subtle, deliberate countenance that gives them substance. macy nails lawrence down to the smallest detail, and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue. by showing, rather than telling, lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer. the supporting cast brings the story together.laura dern is compelling as gerty, lawrence's bombshell wife with a past. trailer park rough, yet other worldly wise, she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of \"a mistake\" and unwittingly exacerbates lawrence's situation. michael lee aday (aka \"meatloaf\") is frightening as fred, the prototypical redneck next door, equal parts ignorance and venom, rallying neighbours to his virulent cause. in the midst of the chaos is finklestein (david paymer), the focus of the aggression, and the voice of reason that raises the important questions. paymer's even handed portrayal keeps finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy, making his one of the strongest performances in the film.the tight editing and close-cropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions, and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town usa feel - it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing. the deliberate use of harsh two-tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack, are powerful without being overwhelming. finally, the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era, an essential component in the film's message.\"focus'\" unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film. just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses. This movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. the horror of \"a tale of two sisters\" lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore; it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout. best of all, the ending does not provide a clear answer, pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place.do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins, and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately. this is not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular. \"a tale of two sisters\" slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end. even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy-handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place. the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this.the true fear of \"a tale of two sisters\" lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares; it is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film. it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so-called 'asian horror' genre. indeed, it would be a mistake to align \"a tale of two sisters\" with films like \"ringu\" and \"the grudge\". this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints, some requiring no suspension of credulity, others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly.whichever way you choose to interpret this film, it is one that demands an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general. Clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series. clint is older but he's still got it, harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where the memorable \"make my day\" catchphrase comes from!) but the city he took a vacation was worse, a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one. the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie! an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. clint eastwood's sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator. worth a watch if you like clint eastwood, the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers. Luc besson's first work is also his first foray in science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with \"the fifth element\" (1997). even if this film was strongly influenced by hollywood cinema, it is still highly enjoyable. back in 1983, \"le dernier combat\" reveals besson's own approach of science fiction. he takes back a threadbare topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work. shot in widescreen and black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more. some barbarian hordes were formed. in parallel, a man (pierre jolivet) lives on his own and arrives in an unrecognizable paris where he is received by a doctor (jean bouise).there are no words in besson's work. the characters' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving, the film has never the look of a despondent one. it seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster. the film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. it's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the prehistoric times. following this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant (jean reno) embodies evil and a threat to the efforts deployed by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being. ditto for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film.the pessimistic whiff that such a film could convey isn't really at the fore and gives way to a glimmer of hope. personally, the film could have gained with no music at all, except the one the man can hear with his cassette recorder. luc besson was to make better and still entrancing films like this one, he also boosted pierre jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy work behind him in the future: \"force majeure\" (1989), \"simple mortel\" (1991), \"ma petite entreprise\" (1999) or \"filles uniques\" (2003). This is definitely one of jet's best efforts. few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can. the action is rapid-fire, and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. as a result, it may take americans a little off-guard. a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film. i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially fist of legend) making it into the us market. a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts. The beautiful, charming, supremely versatile and talented irene dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of american cinema. in over 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural, yet glamorous presence. she is simultaneously authentic and human, and a charismatic, inspirational model. this role is quintessential irene dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief. i love all of her films, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when tcm aired it last night. i hope they don't wait years to air it again.likewise, charles coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of american filmdom. true, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but i never tire of watching his soft-hearted curmudgeons. here his character is the perfect foil for irene dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by coburn. their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic. they never miss a beat. in addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of irene dunne's husband, portrayed by alexander knox.i am not as familiar with knox's work. he was recognizable, but that was about all. however, cast with dunne and coburn, he holds his own. he delivers a fine, nuanced performance. his character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by knox's performance and never held over us like some holy grail. he is noble, but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete ocs. his interaction with dunne, is always convincing, too. dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in kind. their scenes are very well done.the film, itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a milieu not portrayed in other movies. i don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays america still fighting wwii, but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post-war world. not the usual wwii movie! that in itself is interesting; it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message. in contrast to other commentators, i thought that the climactic speech was okay, but not great. it was delivered very well by knox, but it was not as \"tightly\" written as the build-up led me to expect. i have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes. it served its purpose.for me, the greater value of the movie, was the depiction of the life of dunne and knox, as it reflected the typical ocs experience. the sense of community among the wives living on palmetto terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as did palmetto terrace, itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set. the incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their ocs husbands. the rigors of the ocs candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn. the shabby \"base housing\" - obviously hastily constructed. the tired and worn furnishings. the constant and harrowingly short deadlines - for returning to base, for learning lessons, for catching trains to subsequent \"posts.\" tenants constantly running into their predecessors and successors in the base housing, as they were moving in and out. yes, i suspect this was a glimpse of a real wwii experience - clothed in some comedy, but very real at its core. i loved it, and i recommend it highly. This is a film that in no way reflects the real world. nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic. it operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this film.i love the film.somewhere at the very beginning i bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman regaining her memory as the past comes back to haunt her. there was a moment early on where i remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed, despite all logic that it wouldn't happen that way. \"oh its one of those films\" i said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chase.this is an action film with brain and brawn as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns. i like this a great deal and am pleasantly surprised when i bump into people who feel the same way too. people either love it or hate it, if they've ever heard of it at all.if you like action films this is a film to definitely try. you may not like it, but it certainly worth the effort to find outand as always, leave reality at the door. If you're familiar with the work of auteur johnny to and his band of filmmaking cronies over at milky way, you know what to expect with this latest production. all the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a cop and a baddie, the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end, and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations.andy lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company. lau ching-wan (also brilliant in other milky way films like \"longest nite,\" \"a hero never dies,\" and \"where a good man goes\") portrays a hostage negotiator/cop who is on the robber's tail, even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man.funny, poignant, and cool while being subtle, \"running\" is actually one of the most entertaining milky way films to date. don't miss the performances by the two leads, esp. andy lau, usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch. this film is one to go out of your way to see. [warning: contains spoilers]written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky (who also directed) and maya forbes, this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory.jay mohr takes a break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée wants to bed other people and he's allowed to do so, too. julianne nicholson, who was so good in \"tully,\" plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto. too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. good supporting performances help immensely, too. lauren graham, who made last year's \"bad santa\" memorable, plays the jaded, cynical sister to perfection, bryan cranston (the dad on tv's \"malcolm in the middle\") gets a few funny, raunchy moments, and andy richter plays a genial guy who falls for a single mother - helen slater in a credible, albeit familiar, role as a mousy woman.what surprised me most about \"seeing other people\" was how funny it is. there are some genuine laughs here. ed's first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines, and there's a ménage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets tweaked.the film's premise isn't unusual, but i liked that it was alice (nicholson) who thought of it, much to the chagrin of ed (mohr). given the genre, you know that no matter how good her intentions are, alice's plan is doomed. we see how the couple works through this strange situation. initially, alice and ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it.i appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into a cheap sex romp. yes, there's sex and nudity, but there also are real emotions at work here. the \"other people\" alice and ed befriend don't want to be the objects of casual sex; they have feelings, too. in one case, too many feelings.granted, some scenes run one joke too many, the richter-slater subplot isn't necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic. but that's forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty - check out the scenes where ed rummages through alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment - that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed.unfortunately, this film got little, if any, publicity and a limited release. hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film. Despite all of the comparisons to house of frankenstein, this movie outshines its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the universal monsters series, and sadly, the last. o.k. so it doesn't exactly stack up to something like the bride of frankenstein as one a classic to revered by fans of all movies, but with a cast of dracula, the wolf man and frankenstein's monster (what? no mummy?) you can't help but enjoy this schlock fest! and unlike house of frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact a lot more. but this movie also offers some unique story lines for both dracula and the wolf man who both go to dr. adleman for cures of their afflictions. while the wolf man actually does find a cure, dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins! i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. but remember, i never said it was good, just fun. There should be more movies about our native americans. i especially think that using actual real native americans, would be the the right thing. i know that this archie belaney, who was played by pierce brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character, since he was an englishman. but my suggestion to hollywood, is to put more american indians into the roles, and never use anyone else. the sioux nation has been put on the back burner far too long. their poverty is a disgrace to our country. it is my firm belief that our country should return the black hills to the sioux. we ask israel to return their lands to the arabs, but we do not make any effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. we must practice what we preach!. In rosenstrasse, margarethe von trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. the film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter, and the story of german women who staged a protest on rosenstrasse to free their jewish husbands from certain extermination. in addition to the dramatization of historical events, the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the holocaust by a german and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. while ms. von trotta shows that the courage of a small number of germans made a difference, she does not use it to excuse german society. indeed, she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination, the wealthy artists and intellectuals of german high society went on about their lives and parties, oblivious to the suffering.rosenstrasse opens in new york as a jewish widow ruth weinstein (jutta lampe) decides to sit shiva, a seven-day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased. when her daughter hannah (maria schrader), is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fiancé luis (fedja van huet), a non-jew, hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an orthodox tradition that she previously rejected. when ruth coldly rejects her cousin, hannah questions her and learns about a woman named lena who took ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the nazis, and she vows to find lena and discover the secret of her mother's past.her quest takes her to berlin where she finds lena (doris schade), now ninety years old, and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the holocaust. with unfailing memory, lena tells her story of how, as a young 33-year old woman (katja reimann), she searched for her husband, jewish pianist fabian israel fischer (martin feifel), who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given jews in mixed marriages. lena, in a radiant performance by reimann, discovers that her husband and other jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the rosenstrasse.standing together in the freezing night, german women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building, their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting \"give us back our husbands\". lena finds ruth (svea lohde), a young girl whose mother is in the building. she takes care of her, protecting her from the gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed. lena comes from an aristocratic german family and her brother, recently returned from stalingrad, is a wehrmacht officer. after being refused help from her father to free fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow officer, \"i know what they do to the jews. i saw it\". given his support, she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the minister of culture, joseph goebbels, a known womanizer. while this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters, it is a historical fact that goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting rosenstrasse.the director margarethe von trotta, an activist, feminist, and intellectual, is no stranger to political drama. she directed a film about socialist rosa luxembourg and marianne and julianne, a story of the relationship between two sisters, one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives. in rosenstrasse, a film she worked on for eight years, she had to make compromises, adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced. that it works so well is a tribute to ms. von trotta's artistry and the beautiful screenplay by pamela katz whose father was a refugee from leipzig. the events at rosenstrasse give the lie to germans, who say, \"there was nothing we could do\". now von trotta has shown the opposite to be true, that something could be done to resist the nazis. it is tragic that the example did not catch on. Well, it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch. no supernatural stuff, no violence, no profanity. nevertheless, it is a beautiful flick. it's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6-week(that's my best guess for its duration) journey. the characters are everyday people and thus, they are believable. the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. everyone who has a sibling can relate to it. lyle and alvin don't even have to say anything. for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten. I saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channel-surfing before going to bed, and really liked what i saw. since then i've been on the lookout, scouring tv listings, flipping through dvd/vhs racks at stores, but didn't find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it. then, being a world-class procrastinator, i still didn't order it. finally, i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland, or, a few weeks ago. then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it.so, what do i think about the film? it's good. not as good as i remembered and hoped for, but still well worth the $9.99 it cost me. after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 7/10, with potential to become an 8/10. i'll have to be less sleepy then, and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue. I had the pleasure of screening \"the big bad swim\" at the 2006 new london film festival last week. the festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. it was my assumption that \"the big bad swim\" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around eastern connecticut. however, as the credits began to roll i could only think about how well \"the big bad swim\" compared to the others featured during the festival. by far it topped my list, followed by \"the puffy chair\", \"who killed the electric car\" and \"transamerica\".the \"the big bad swim\" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that i've not seen on screen in quite a while. the interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which i found refreshing. the plot doesn't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a pace that was spot on. i was never bored. i never cringed. i never stepped out of the story on the screen.the humor of the film is something like \"napoleon dynamite\" meets \"old school\". the acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived. obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot weren't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. the lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in \"closer\". i also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be.i sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but i have to say it: if \"the big bad swim\" isn't picked up for some kind of distribution i would extremely disappointed. \"the big bad swim\" needs to be seen. if you have the chance to see this film, see it! disappointment is impossible!. Cleopatra (the delicious monica bellucci) is challenged by cesar (alain chabat): in order to prove that the egyptians are better than the romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for cesar in a period of three months, without any delay. she calls the one-arm architect numerobis (jamel debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission, or become crocodile food if he fails. numerobis will ask for help to panoramix (claude rich), asterix (christian clavier) and obelix (geraard depardieu) (with ideiafix). this movie is very funny, specially the parts where obelix and the pirates leaded by red beard participate. however, the screenwriter and the director should have noted that french is not an universal language as english is. therefore, the jokes with words (like in austin powers movies, for example) does not work well for people strange to french language. french people and persons fluent in french language will certainly like these jokes, but they do not make any sense for me, that do not speak french. my vote is seven. This is, by far, the best movie i've seen in a long while. it is a wholly original and beautiful plot. it is not boring, nor is it too dramatic. the characters are tangible and realistic, but it does not take away from the story line. the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch. the end leaves you fulfilled in a way i've never experienced in a movie before. i wish i had found this movie earlier.more lines.more lines.more lines a lot more lines c'mon, i'm done. The bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy jason bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is \"universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.first, i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to ultimatum. there may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like i was. you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy. jason bourne is played very well by mattdamon. damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.i won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. however, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3. it's the best action movie i've seen since live free or die hard.good) damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie bad) story is like many others. This comedy is bound to be good from the get-go. east meets west and east doesn't want to lose...west doesn't know what losing is like. it starts a little slow but it grabs you very soon and it doesn't let go. this is definitely worth seeing. Bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant. expertly scripted and perfectly delivered, this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter. it's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society (or to be more accurate, of any society). following the escapades of keisha, latrina and natella, our three \"protagonists\" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject. political correctness flies out the window in every episode. if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then bromwell high will not disappoint!. I absolutely loved this film! i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful. i remember how hard it was when john was shot. however, watching the \"two of us\" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what \"might have been.\" aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on. i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john. my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which i feel are appropriate, given the circumstances. The van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years. i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time!!the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york, and the impression i had of \"trying to be as american as possible\" ... which i think has absolutely failed.the scenes in the back really got to my heart. the german actress katja riemann completely deserved her award. she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen. in future i will watch more of her movies. great luck for me that i am a native german speaking =) and only for a year in the us, so as soon as i am back i'll buy some riemann dvds.so to all out there who have not seen this movie yet: watch it!!! i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet, especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain, but simply watcxh it, you will be zesty!!!!!!!. I have to tell you, this is a great movie. it surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be. this one is just fabulous. it could be that it isn't trying too hard to send any kind of message; it just tells a whimsical, fun story. i gave it a 10 out of 10. While browsing the internet for previous sale prices, i ran across these comments. why are they all so serious? it's just a movie and it's not pornographic. i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it. i've shown it to many of my friends & they all loved it too. i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known. after reading the other comments, i agree that the film is \"racy\". big deal! i only wish it was longer. it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals, for sale at least, so i wonder how much it's worth?. I have always loved the muppets. though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, the muppet's was. the muppet's are very, very funny. they are probably the most likable children's characters ever. not only did the muppets have their own show. they also have starred in many films. from the muppet's christmas carol to the muppet's treasure island. the first muppet's movie, the muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.the muppet movie is about how they all got started. kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in hollywood. so kermit takes off for hollywood. along the way he runs into lots of people such as fozzie bear, gonzo the great, and miss piggy. also, an evil man is trying to capture kermit.all of the muppet films are highly enjoyable. i mean they are all very funny. this film has many film appearances. such as steve martin, mel brooks, elliot gould, carol kane, richard pryor, and orson welles. the muppet films are all very enjoyable. i hear that jason segel is going to star in one soon. i can't wait to see it. I am fifteen years old and have seen thirty-three of sinatra's films (not counting videos of tv shows and documentaries) and have been unimpressed by only two of them. ''till the clouds roll by,\" and \"the miracle of the bells\" don't really count, however, considering that in the first all he does is sing a magnificent \"ol' man river,\" and in the latter he's not half bad-only the picture is pathetic. my favorite records, radio shows, tv shows, and movies concerning sinatra change virtually every day-everything taking on a different connotation at each viewing and occasionally seeming the best thing he ever did and occasionally the worst until the cycle comes around again, but there are a couple things that are beyond comparison. when it comes to movies, \"the man with the golden arm\" heads that list. everybody who knows anything about sinatra knows he thought this was his best-ever performance; he was oscar-nominated; it was the first serious look at drug addiction; etc.,etc. the jazz score is unforgettable, kim novak's likable despite a ludicrous accent, eleanor parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic, the turtle-like arnold stang is amusing the first time but more embarrassing every time out, and darren mcgavin makes a wonderfully slimy drug dealer, the sets are unconvincing - at first glance it seems a peculiar mixed bag tossed together by the great otto preminger with an off-center charm. then you come to sinatra. like everything else in his life - other than music - reports of his acting are alway divided in half. directors like fred zinnemann, frank capra, billy wilder, stanley kramer, martin scorsese, peter bogdanovich, and otto preminger, all agreed that had sinatra worked as hard on his films as he did on singing, he'd have been among the greatest actors in the world - if not the greatest. humphrey bogart even said,\"this guy has the most natural acting talent i've ever seen.\" not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in his life, was at the same time producing the discography that would make him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century,\" and did almost all his scenes in one take. in direct conflict with all of this are those other reviews and biographies that sniff haughtily about what a lousy actor was this mr.sinatra, and how many \"bad\" movies he made. the question will never be answered to everyone's satisfaction because controversy was among sinatra's greatest assets, and both arguments were in a sense playing into his hand. in any case, at this time, in this role, sinatra is magnificent. a reviewer said in the late fifties,\"sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but there is none more fascinating to watch.\" no matter what sinatra is doing in a film, it's hard to take your eyes off him. this, of course, is a \"charisma,\" that i've only seen in a handful of other people-orson welles, richard burton, marlon brando, montgomery clift-perhaps james cagney. there's no real definition for it and it often makes it hard to figure out whether you're really enjoying a performance or just spellbound, but that quality on display here is what makes the movie. sinatra is downright riveting, real, intense - transcending decades and thousands of paper-doll pop stars with something called quality. like it or not, this is a one-man show with a few character actors hanging around in the background. he covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety, from sweet, lonely tenderness with kim novak to the terrifying shock of frank sinatra (frank sinatra!) whimpering and screaming in the agony of \"cold turkey.\" sinatra was right - this is his best performance. no question. i was eight when frank sinatra died. i wasn't around for all the years of bobby-soxers and ''anchors aweigh,'' mr. ava gardner and ''from here to eternity,\" albums with lamp posts and ''swingin' lovers,\" kennedy, vegas, ring-a- ding ding. basie and mia and reagan and concerts from madison square garden to south africa to the white house to the sands. i can't say i like sinatra because i heard him at the paramount or because i hear \"september of my years\" autobiographically-the usual excuses. and my excuse? when i was eleven i watched a movie called \"on the town\"... I think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made, and i've seen many... the book is better, but it's still a very good movie!. Six teenagers go to an old remote abandoned school where 27 years ago a horrible massacre took place for a night of fun and pranks. instead the kids run afoul of the vicious crazed security guard (excellently played with supremely creepy menace by spanish horror icon paul naschy) who committed the nasty killings. director carlos gil relates the intriguing story at a brisk pace and does an adept job of creating a compellingly spooky and mysterious atmosphere. the witty script by tino blanco and mercedes holgueras offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the very end. the slick cinematography by fernando arribas makes expert use of light and shadow. david san jose's moody score likewise does the trick. the attractive and appealing young cast all contribute lively and engaging performances, with especially praiseworthy turns by carlos fuentes as ringleader ramon, olivia molina as the panicky maria, zoe berriatua as obnoxious joker jordi, and carmen morales as spunky goth chick sandra. the murder set pieces are every bit as bloody and brutal as they ought to be. terrific whammy of a surprise dark ending, too. a solid and satisfying shocker. Thank god this wasn't based on a true story, because what a story it is. populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, before the devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren't carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn't hurt either.the main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.the story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: \"charlie: two days before the robbery\", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life. throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to gina (marisa tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from albert finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you've got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hands. proceed with caution. Amazing movie i saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that i had not even heard of it before getting on that plane. while it may seem, at first to be a \"chick flick\", it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy. men, watch this movie with someone you love. you will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points. An astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien-outlaws. this incredible plotted and enjoyable tv-installment comes along as a positive birth-fantasy. the individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last. most of the action takes place inside the womb of moia, the living space-ship (who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). while science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasies (watch the 'alien'-movies for example, especially the fourth part 'resurrection') this comes as a surprise. also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. one of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences 'photogasms' while being exposed to sunlight. the crew even has to go to the toilet. wouldn't that be impossible in 'star trek'?. This is an excellent stand-up dvd! eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years. his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it. i highly recommend this one. the part about the history of europe is a bit slow, but the ending jokes in french are quite good, because you don't have to speak french to get it (although if you do, it is still hilarious). also, the parts about being a transvestite are quite good. the first scene (about san francisco) is not great, but funny the first time. skip over those if you can. it's almost not worth watching. however, this really is a funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. \"i was dead at the time!\". This is the first movie i ever owned on video, and 14 years later, i still have the same copy. elizabeth taylor was as radiant at twelve as ever later in life, mickey rooney gave real dimension to mi taylor, and donald crisp was solid as ever as mr. brown. the amazing anne revere, as mrs. brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. after nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor, and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, root for the pie, and love velvet for the spirit and capacity for love that she displays. i love it as an adult just as i loved it as a child. a must for every family video collection. I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase i'm going through. i was born in 1980, and so film from mid-80s to mid-90s has quite an important place in my growing up.this particular movie was one of my favourites, and so i was thrilled when it became available in the uk. it hasn't become worse with time, it is still a great fun film, with plenty of excitement in its own way. sure, it pales in the shadow of bigger, larger budget films, but don't let that stop you enjoying this.worth a rent, or even a purchase at the discount prices you'll find it for. I wish there were more films about middle aged people. the intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. there seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. amy watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. if she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce. the country and london scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the autumnal weather adds to the melancholy background superbly. the ending is perfect, so in tune with real adult life. So many early british sound films that i've seen on video suffer from either poor print transfer quality or poor sound or both. fortunately, i was able to obtain a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality, enabling me to focus on the story itself.and, an excellent story it was. at first sight, the passengers on the ill-fated bus looked like a pretty boring lot (except for the always lovely jessie matthews). but, as the film went back to show each passenger's story on the day before the accident, i discovered that the cast, contrary to initial appearance, was a talented group of performers, skillfully directed so as to bring a real individuality to their distinctive characterizations.viewers may have different preferences as to which two passengers are going to meet a tragic end and which ones will survive. but, the movie holds your interest as it keeps you guessing. this film deserves a much wider audience - a real gem of early british cinema. Victor sjostrom's silent film masterpiece the phantom carriage has recently been released on dvd with a new soundtrack recorded by ktl. the duo, comprising american guitarist stephen o'malley and austrian laptop artist peter rehberg, has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921. an ominous banging sound introduces each act and a medley of drones, guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds.as impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. according to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on new year's eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage, collecting the souls of the dead. this is the fate of the anti-hero of the film, david holm, who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage.this film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label, the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others. sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as the drunken, spiteful and menacing holm in life, and the wretched, frightened holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds.striking imagery abounds throughout the phantom carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. the ill-omened onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clock-face hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon. equally impressively, the dead are depicted through pioneering semi-transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch.sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by ktl is a superb accentuation of its themes. this is a must-see. A have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend. of course the sob is very good-looking, charming, etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman. watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends. it's tragic, and you know she's going to end up very hurt, but there's nothing you can do. leaud is brilliant. totally empty. a blank throughout, he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants.the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love, and the next morning he puts on a record and, very sweetly and charmingly, sings along to amuse her is brilliant. the \"what the hell am i doing here with this idiot\" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come.it's a long film, but see it in one go, preferably in a cinema. takes a while to get into, but then the time just disappears. Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up.tony shaloub executes a flawless performance as an russian scientist (phd) who cannot find decent work in america. he befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab.the chief doctor is a bitter man, as paulie, who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn, embarasses the doctor, who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building, where mikail (tony s.) finds him.paulie recants his life with marie and how they lost each other. the quest begins to reunite paulie with marie, only more than 20 years has passed.the movie ends, some will say predictably, with mikail reuniting paulie with marie. the story closes with the three entering marie's home, where you can make the final your own choice.great family film!. Deep water (2006) ****\"it is indifferent... it's there waiting for you to make one slip up.\" those words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean i have ever heard muttered. its furies are boundless, not least of which, her loneliness. those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary deep water. it is the story of donald crowhurst, an amateur sailor who partook in the 1969 sunday times race around the world. if you do not know his story, it may be best to stop reading now. don't read this or any other information on crowhurst or the race. find the film and just watch it. after the first solo circumnavigation of the ocean in 1967, adventurers and watchers of adventurers began seeking the next one-up. this time the journey would have to be done without making landfall or stopping along the way. having fallen on hard times, crowhurst saw the race as a great chance to get his family back on their feet. he had lived through financial hardships as a child, and wanted part in going back to such a life. so he set out to find sponsors, and soon did in stanley best and rodney hallworth. the two men spelled the potential cash cow, and granted crowhurst a boat, on the condition that if he should pull out of the race he would be forced himself to pay the expenses. his boat however was in serious need of repairs, and he feared it would not be ready in time for the final departure day. he was informed however by his sponsor's that he simply must go  after all, they ponied up the dough and expected it back many a time over. the details of the story are infamous: crowhurst's boat began taking on water, and his progress slowed to a crawl. faced with the decision of trying to round the horn of africa (certain death in such a boat) or turn back (financial devastation and destitution), he searched for a third option. he chose to hide out, alone on his yacht, waiting for other competitors to round cape horn in south america. from there he would rejoin the race. he reported false positions, and record breaking speeds. then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be given away. he also had to painstakingly construct fake log books for each day of a journey he did not take. eventually the loneliness, the guilt, and the realization that he would likely be caught weighed too heavy on crowhurst. his final log entries make the musings of a kurtz seem entirely sane. only a few weeks from home, he turned his boat away from home, and is reported to have jumped overboard soon thereafter. crowhurst's odyssey is a fascinating one, and its ending is heartbreaking, but strikes of inevitability. our dreams so often turn into fears, and the consequences of our actions often leave us so few options for a happy ending. it is a story of a descent into madness, teased on by the infinite abyss of the cruel seas. the filmmakers do a wonderful job in telling this story. it's put together with chilling audio and video recordings done by crowhurst, and narrations of his ever-increasingly maddening log notes. the story starts slowly, and may distract some viewers, but the rewards of the story are entirely worthwhile as it progresses. there are also inquiries into some of the other competitors, such as frenchman bernard moitessier, who was on par to likely win the speed competition, only to pull out and begin a second trip around the world. also in the film is robin knox-johnston, who was the winner of the competition. he donated his prize money to the crowhurst family. to read briefly on the crowhurst saga simply does not do justice. it's interesting of course, but a quick browse bypasses the raw emotions and oddness presented here. the final moments of deep water are genuinely heart breaking, hearing the thoughts of his widowed family, and the adoration and understanding of his friends. this is a fascinating story, and it is that which carries the documentary into such great channels. I watched this movie every chance i got, back in the seventies when it came out on cable. it was my introduction to harlem, which has fascinated me (and bill clinton) ever since. i was still very young, and the movie made a big impression on me. it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up, trying to decide whom they wanted to be, and making some bad choices as well as good ones. i was dazzled by lonette mckee's beauty, the great dresses they eventually got to wear, and the snappy dialogue. as someone being raised by a single mother as well, i could really identify with these girls and their lives. it's funny, these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles!. I thought this movie was excellent,for the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the business.it was packed with action and a little romance,but there were some points when corrine didn't speak very clearly (when she threatened sean with the gun) and she clenched her teeth...maybe she was supposed to?i think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very well,and there was an obvious contrast.also,because i watched next action star,i am certain that corrine and sean did their own stunts,which were performed very well.i am looking forward to another movie by the pair,as they make a great team,or perhaps a sequel to bet your life-possibly called 'making it big in the big apple',it could this time be about carmen..bet your life is excellent!. This as the first of the ma and pa kettle flicks. marjorie main (ma) steals the show in anything she does. funny to see ida moore as emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was always old; she was in \"desk set\" and \"alfred hitchcock presents\". their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that pa doesn't care for. love the painting gag. keep an eye out for tom... he starred in \"nanny & the professor\". unfortunately he died real young... oddly enough, his last role was on the series \"death cruise\". weird. directed by charles lamont, who not only directed several of the kettle films, he also did a bunch of the abbott and costello flicks, so he must have known a thing or two about comedy. fun story, plain, simple humor. even the release date was april fool's day, 1949. the story starts out by showing us what backward and country-folk they are (the neighbors are even native americans), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for them. Bugs life is a good film. but to me, it doesn't really compare to movies like toy story and stuff. don't get me wrong, i liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as toy story. the film has the visuals, the laughs, and others that toy story had. but the film didn't feel quite as... i don't know, but i thought it was still a pretty good film. a bugs life... i don't want to say this, is a film that i don't remember. i saw it years ago. of course, i haven't seen toy story in years, but i still remember it. i shouldn't have reviewed this film, but i am. i am giving it a thumbs up, though it's not exactly the best work pixar has done.a bug's life:***/****. This film was different. it took a sort of typical thriller story and reached for a more interesting, in-depth look at an individual character's struggle with faith. of course, it helped that the main performance, by andrew mccarthy, was quite excellent. the other performances were also quite interesting, although not as consistent. the ending was a bit of a let down, but there were lots of good moments. the film-makers tried something different here -- they didn't just go for the obvious chills and scares. this is a dark film (not for everyone) but if you want to be entertained and not talked down to, try this one. At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. from here we follow six separate students; marcus, melody, luke, steven, sarah and sean. each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point, hitting to an end for one.after losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer/director murali k. thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide. suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows, 2:37 is thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. if you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2:37 becomes all the harder to view.with heavy and hard subject matter, thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis's. sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner. the factor on thalluri's talent is his subtlety. he respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. it verges near documentary at times, it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this.2:37 has a distinctive similarity to gus van sants film elephant. while the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. like sant, thalluri utilizes long tracking shots, with time skipping back and forth, to show each characters interaction from different perspectives. a defining point to elephant was its ethereal ambiance. with spare conversation, little development of characters, and the long tracking shots, sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread. while there resides this dread in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level sant couldn't reach. as time goes by, each characters fragility creeps out, dragging you along their emotional roller-coaster.the real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide, foretold at the very beginning. the hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion. though many films that have shown suicide, gloss over the act or romanticizes the act. thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution. with unknowns in the leads and their first major roles; teresa palmereach, frank sweet, joel mackenzie, marni spillane, charles baird and sam harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers.compelling and revetting, 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film. \"the next karate kid\" is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. it has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. hilary swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of julie. i have seen the actor who plays mr. miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. the movie is funny and charming and i cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is. i definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. i suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie. As with so many modern us films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.we are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. beau bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub beau's nose. d'onofrio finds his rather surface bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his 'blessed' baby brother, joey, and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town. their boss's business is closing down (much against his will) because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self-destruction.joey, who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives, is lost at sea - believed drowned - in a freak accident. his miraculous restoration to them by the portuguese trawlermen whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew), is the sign they've been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the dice.there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which excelled in holding our attention as brilliantly as 'the shipping news'. there are other parallels with the later work, too, which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake. i like 'signs of life' for its simpler, less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars. Many of the american people would say...what??? to my opening comment. yes i know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the master akira kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. we have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. the great difference is the way that the story takes. our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, heroes. please watch again this incredible movie (the seven samurai, obviously) and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of akira kurosawa. a tip is the 13th warrior with antonio banderas, michael crichton copied the story to wrote his best seller's, but he didn't found the third foot of the cat. I'm a fan of both actors/singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer,i just think this is a silly one.after a long waiting time,i watched it at last and here's my comment...i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first applause goes to acting,generally that japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.yet in moonchild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it,especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for hyde part,his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.i didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel of the film is story.it has some cheesy moments but it's ok for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals.an interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of american cinema,actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew,yet original on it's own.only problem that moonchild is it's a bit slow sometimes,i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it's not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters.but all in all;this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future,and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10. This is a refreshing, enjoyable movie. if you enjoyed, \"four weddings and a funeral\", \"peter's friends\", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. made me laugh, made me sad. i view movies for entertainment, and english-set movies generally fit that bill for me. enjoy!. This movie is a fascinating drama about the making of a movie. the actor and the actress really can't stand each other, but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex - she for the first time, per script. the actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot, aside from she is freezing in the early scenes on a beach. the actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the director, jeanne. i could not help being drawn in to the drama of 'how are these two possibly going to act their way thru a sex scene?' that drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras. not that roxane mesquida isn't lovely and worth seeing naked! however, there is a pretty young stage hand who walks thru a few scenes as an extra. i think that is her in the far left edge of one of the pictures (2 of 9) here in imdb. i don't even know if this girl is credited, but when she walks by (fully dressed of course) in confident indifference with her short blonde hair -- she is sexy! who is this girl???. \"step by step,\" is my opinion, is a pure abc hit! i can't recall every episode, but i still enjoyed it. it's hard to say which episode was my favorite. however, i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred at school. i always laugh at that. as a matter of fact, i think just about every single one of j.t. (brandon call) and cody's (sasha mitchell) lines were funny. it would have been nice if penny (patrika darbo) had stayed on the show throughout its entire run. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, i hope it never stops airing in syndication. Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. not that this ever bothered me anyway, since i love low budget sci-fi like dr who, blake's 7 and dark star. hell, even outland wasn't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.the story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. they then discover the prisoner has made it too, he's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems.the effects, except for the gunfights, are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it. computer effects look a bit dodgy at times, but serve their purpose well and add to the story, lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings. films like i, robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot, like all too many of hollywood's offerings.whilst none of the actors get oscar material, it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn't outstay its welcome. the characters don't get fleshed out much, but then they didn't in predator either, which it resembles in feel. big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn.some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end, but i like it. unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained, it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all, and i'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further.a cracking little film from an enterprising team, done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour. if this is what they can do on a shoestring i'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash, and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first.recommended. Once again, there's dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events. in this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology. although the creature is no e.t. he does seem to befriend one youngster, who protects it at all costs, not realising it is but an infant of the species and is going to get a lot bigger  and badder this 2005 series had a lot going for it. it is family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comedic moments. the characters are believable, well acted and well photographed. the show holds the attention. of course, as with any sci-fi show, suspension of disbelief has to be achieved. and i think it is here. alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a resolution. infuriating.. there is a general comment i feel worth making here. many tv networks and/or film distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, seemingly excellent tv series  particularly intelligent sci-fi ones. now there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons. this in itself is annoying. what really gets my goat is that, having cancelled the series, they then issue the thing as far as it's got, on dvd, in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible. for previous viewers of the series that's ok, they know what they're in for but  many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger. two that come to mind immediately are \"surface\", and \"odyssey 5\". if you've heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted dvd and end up with an unresolved plot issue  it makes me very angry!! i enjoyed \"surface\" immensely and didn't realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable  and we'll never know what happened next. i believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such dvd issues, to the effect that the story is unfinished. nowadays i check on tv series purchases (imdb is an obvious excellent starting point) to find out whether a 'complete' series is really complete or not. buyer beware. This movie is just brilliant, srk's acting is just amazing, the end is so incredibly sad, i cry every time i see this film, it's the kind you never get sick of, and can see again and again, an absolutely amazingly brilliant movie. I'm not sure why i picked for a borrow from mom for \"nurse betty\". i think just because i had heard a little bit of this movie. but i'm glad i did. \"nurse betty\" is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side. this was one of renee's first big one's before hitting it major in hollywood. i can see why, she is an incredible actress. the scene where she finally realizes what had happened and she's on the set of her favorite soap opera, you can see pain, confusion, fear, and embarrassment on her face. just to let you in on the movie, she plays betty. a shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband, she's a waitress, and is in love with soap operas, especially one where a certain cute doctor, dr. dave revell. when she happens to see her husband's murder accidentally in separate room, the murders she notices are two customers she just had, morgan freeman and chris rock. she then just looses her mind and leaves town after talking to he police and says she needs to find her former fiancée, dr. dave revell. so, she travels along the country to california to find dr. revell, and wants a job as a nurse to work with dave, she's seen the show so many times, somehow she's just awesome at being a nurse when she saves a woman's brother. despite everyone telling her that she is delusional, she just looks at them like as if they were the crazy one's. when she meets the actor who plays dave revell, george(his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. she just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her belong together.renee was terrific, she was so believable on loosing her mind in the movie. she has come such a long way, and wither you want to admit it or not, she's adorable and a great actress.morgan freeman plays one of the assassin's, charlie, who is the father of the two. he is so charmed and smittened by betty and while chasing her around the country, he becomes almost just infatuated with betty to the point where he almost falls in love with her. he and his son wesley must find betty when they find out she was there at the murder scene and could give away their identities. when charlie sees betty and catches her finally, she's scarred at first, but calms down and they know they have a real connection. it was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that morgan gave a stronger performance. he's just great.a surprisingly decent performance by chris rock, the son, wesley. he is so \"gun\"-ho about just getting the job done in a rush and taking care of business. i loved his comedic performance at the end where he and the gang he's holding hostage by gun point are just watching the soap opera's together. classic. \"nurse betty\" is a great movie that i'd recommend for a good laugh and just in all a nice honest little movie i think anyone could enjoy.9/10. Reading a wide variety of \"scoop\" reviews over the past few days, i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody. happily, i couldn't have been more wrong. granted, woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but woody the writer/director is in fine form - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. judging from the laughter and guffaws, the audience ate up allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years. in a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path. Stars: danny devito, billy crystal, anne ramsey, kim griest, kate mulgrew, oprah winfrey and rob reiner.after college class, teacher larry (crystal) wants his ex-wife dead and owen (devito) wants his momma (ramsey) dead. when larry brings up that he wants his wife dead, owen knows what he must do for him, in order for a favor in return, for larry to kill his mother. devito is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has daydreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors through her head. he has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer. ramesy was actually nominated for an academy award for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old mrs. lift. along with having comedy, the film also has heart. one scene between devito and crystal starts off seemingly as a joke, but goes deeper, actually making me slightly sad. danny devito directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction. for any fan of comedies i recommend this.my rating: b plus. 84 mins. pg-13 for language, sexuality and violence. Love trap is not a short, it's quite obviously a full length feature film with a running time of 105 minutes.while i'm writing this, i might as well talk a bit more about love trap. i'm frequently asked what makes love trap different... this is how i respond to that question: 1) it introduces characters - one in particular - that have never been seen before in film, period.2) it reveals more truth about love, and delves more deeply into the very concept of love, than any other u.s. film ever made, in my humble opinion.3) structurally, as in the way the story is told, it is unlike any love story you've ever seen.4) it offers extremely timely insights on various cultural issues, both within and outside the black community.over time, people will come to see love trap as about as wholly an original work as possible in this era, delightfully refreshing, authentic and honest. it is a rare morality play full of food for thought.please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate info about this film. I can't stand people who comment on this program or other hbo programs as \"too graphic\" or \"unnecessarily graphic\" or that they contain \"gratuitous nudity/violence/sodomy etc\".guess what? prison life isn't pg-13. the \"gratuitous\" graphic content is true to life of this situation. prison contains inmate rape/killings/drug deals and showers. if you don't like it, then don't watch the program. i'm certainly no fan of prison rape, but if it was left out of the show i'd be surprised and lend the show less credibility. if the prisoners didn't curse, it would just be silly. sure it's gratuitous language, but that is realistic.the show is good, some of the viewers....not so much, i guess. Fans of euro-horror flicks - portland's video/dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss sergio martino's gut-busting \"l'isola degli uomini pesce\" (called \"screamers\" in the united states). here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted caribbean island in 1891. the island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (joseph cotten) and his daughter (barbara bach). sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men. and while the fish-men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion, they get nasty otherwise.this movie is sort of a mixture of genres: euro-horror, swashbuckling, voodoo, and maybe a little bit of \"the island of dr. moreau\". but it's mostly an excuse to have the fish-men disembowel trespassers; ya gotta love that! i wouldn't be surprised if the euro-horror genre gave quentin tarantino some of his ideas for \"grindhouse\". after all, the european horror directors have no scruples about what they show. this is one that you're sure to like.so joseph cotten is the only cast member from an alfred hitchcock movie (i mean \"shadow of a doubt\") who later co-starred with ringo starr's soon-to-be wife and audrey hepburn's ex (by whom i mean mel ferrer) in an italian horror flick. the things that we see in life... 039: anna christie (1930) - released 2/21/1930; viewed 3/10/06 on october 24, 1929: black thursday, the stock market crashes. now the country and indeed the world will look to hollywood for escape from the worldwide great depression.births: anne frank, june carter, yasser arafat, bob newhart, barbara walters, doris roberts, ed asner, dick clark, roy e. disney, gene hackman.doug: at long last, our odyssey resumes in earnest with greta garbo's first sound film, a simple character study called anna christie. an excellent performance from ms. garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them. how odd). one thing i noticed over and over was the way the swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter j with a y sound. anna ends up being the only character i liked; i didn't really care for her estranged father or her would-be suitor. it looks like the sound-recording systems are getting better (nobody leaning in to talk into the mystery-can), but the camera still isn't moving. we'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues.kevin: our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent starlet greta garbo, anna christie. this is a very simple movie, with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's 89 minute running time, often with a static camera. it was great to see marie dressler in sound as well, and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet inebriated slurs. i very much enjoyed garbo's performance, as she sustains the film through even the most meandering moments. i didn't really like george marion or charles bickford, maybe because i wasn't sympathetic to either of them, so i was relieved and excited when anna finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't \"belong\" to either her estranged father or her muscle-bound irish boyfriend. it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.last film viewed: speedy (1928). last film chronologically: the love parade (1929). next film: the blue angel (1930). This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. it was really funny in one moment (probably why i liked it) and then just as serious in the next. plus, it had ellen in it and i've always had a soft spot for her.basically, the owner of a book store, helen (kate capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. she thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. she has kind of shut herself off from the world, so it really throws her for a loop. eventually, almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals which creates some really funny moments.like i said, i am usually not one for this type of movie but i really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly. Director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film \"elevated\", wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building. his follow-up feature project \"cube\", released later that year, had a very similar premise, this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps. both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further, by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation, choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element, how the characters act, react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions. after his exploration into the mainstream with 2002's \"cypher\", natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us \"nothing\", his latest, and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of \"what if?\"dave (david hewlett) and andrew (andrew miller) are life-long friends, brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with. dave, who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature, lives rent-free with andrew at his ill-located and ill-constructed house, where he often takes advantage of andrew's neurotic and antisocial mentality. despite all this, the two misfits are happy together, until one day their deep character flaws, coupled with some astronomically bad luck, land them in the middle of some pretty serious, jail-sentence-worthy trouble. on top of this, they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset, so in the hazy, nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them, they wish that the whole world would just disappear. and it does.going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film's slow (occasionally too slow) reveal about what's happened to dave and andrew, and how they deal with their new reality. natali's fascination with studying human behavior under duress (ala the birds) is here in spades, but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers, he's able to break away from the thriller-horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level. it's almost as if he's made the aphoristic opposite of \"cube\".of course, the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine. in keeping with fundamental realism, our two anti-heroes' dynamic often becomes antagonistic, sometimes with rather nasty results. like the \"desert island\" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence. in a very twisted, sci-fi way, this is a feel-good flick, with good heart and good intentions.however, there are a few qualms to be had with \"nothing\". while the two lead actors, hewlett and miller, do well with their parts, their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been, considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour. there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew, some background is given, but ultimately not enough. a generous viewer will sit through the less-engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end, but cynics will probably give up pretty fast.acting, as mentioned, is adequate, and considering the amount of 'green-screen' work that would've been needed, reasonably convincing. david hewlett and andrew miller, who both wrote co-wrote the screenplay, have been long-time friends of vincenzo natali: hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made. perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction. nonetheless, the story could have been a lot more involving. granted, it is relatively entertaining considering that (no pun intended) nothing really happens, but you get the impression that, in more experienced hands, a lot more could've been done with this premise.in all fairness, \"nothing\" is an impressive piece of work in many ways. the concept is interesting, the direction is inventive, the script works on a human level and, most of all, it shows a progression in natali's creative mentality. for fans of his work, this will be a delight, and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time. it's just a shame that the director's fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great, fun film it could have been. I saw this movie in santa monica on aug. 23 and it has stayed with me. i want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of harry's enigmatic, eccentric, life. and also for showing the flaws and failings of nilsson the man. thanks for showing the good and bad, the ups and downs, and for uncovering that amazing bbc footage. the film is also a great showcase of a vast amount of nilsson's music, really well placed throughout the film. i recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries, especially if you are interested in harry nilsson or the music scene of the early 70's. some reviewer at the ain't it cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the santa barbara film festival, and i believe it. the film is informative, funny, sad, touching, and full of awesome music. it succeeds on all levels. really, really good. Maybe i'm reading into this too much, but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film. i mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased.but...his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongsheng's life. i think the best view would have been told from hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. they saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.as for hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his family's happiness. huh?the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. he lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to the side.it's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.this same device is used in ted demme's \"blow\" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.however, \"quitting\" (\"zuotian\") is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. but, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. it makes the viewer feel as if hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many difficult parts. This highly underrated film is (to me) what good writing in a movie should be all about. kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at. the movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life.  along the way we are asked question after question about life. davis (steve martin with a great beard) asks himself 'is my making a violent movie (and by extension our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?' claire asks \"what kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life?' mack is not immune as he asks 'is it possible to pass beyond the bounds of race and (an even harder step) finance? these are of course not quoted from the film, but generalities. others ask their questions too, and to be honest it raises more than it answers. but that is the nature of life. we strive all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer, and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires. as humans we thrive on questions we cannot answer. some answers are real. claire and mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby, their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands. some answers are not. davis `sees the light' and decides not to make violent films, but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art. we all seek answers. this movie does not answer them for; it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers. I saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits (such as the 'cafe bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic. this is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular. please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon. i completely see what the writer/director was going for, and he hit the target perfectly! this film is highly deserving of a better rating. \"crossfire\" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that's a murder mystery with a strong message. it stars robert young, robert mitchum, robert ryan, sam levene, and gloria grahame, and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk. we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, young, as the detective, finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. the victim, joseph samuels (sam levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and samuels winds up dead.i don't know about 1947, but seeing \"crossfire\" today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. i don't suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. nevertheless, the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence, and unsparing anti-semite language.the characterizations are vivid, including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role - she's a woman who meets mitchell (george cooper), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan, but everyone is excellent. robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife.truly excellent, and a must see. I rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it, part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night. after several awful american action adventure films (ballistic, daredevil, cradle of life) zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking. the story is complete nonsense, but i found the film's sincerity, good- heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. sure, the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood, but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking. in one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock, a huge moon rising before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. in another, a princess-warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. and the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotion rather than to represent reality.the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters, offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. physically, several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful. they play their roles straight up, without irony or guile, and so are believable.most strange of all, despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations, i found myself very near tears at the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, good-hearted vision of the director. The 1973 musical version of lost horizon is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of all time. the 1973 musical remake of the james hilton novel about mythical shangri-la! is a real special gem. music by burt bacharach and lyrics by hal david. a strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. it has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. this film was a critical and financial disappointment in the united states, but made a lot of money overseas. only in america did it fail. highly different and unique in it's approach as a film musical, it deserves far better credit than it's given. as a story, lost horizon is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 frank capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the james hilton novel. what i like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. the film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. this is a burt bacharach shangri-la and it's a wonderful place. songs like the world is a circle, share the joy and living together, growing together evoke a happiness that hilton wrote about in his novel. why shouldn't shangri-la be a slightly goofy place? the two love songs, i might frighten her away and the deleted i come to you are the sensitive spots in the picture. there's a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story. moreover, the things i will not miss is a good duet with a strong melody. it's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with olivia hussey and sally kellerman stomping, singing and dancing on tables? they're a wonderful team and the number is well staged. i always found it interesting in this story how the high lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in shangri-la. the character of the high lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole. he has no hope for the world outside of shangri-la. if this film were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character, richard onway's conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in shangri-la.of course, for the film to be believable, the character of richard conway must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. neither film versions of lost horizon were faithful to the novel in that regard. did conway find shangri-la or was it imagined? did they all die in the plane crash? every man has his own idea of what his shangri-la would be. the conflict with conway wanting to believe in shangri-la and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. i like the melancholy on the faces of kellerman, kennedy and van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. interesting how conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. both versions of lost horizon work in different ways, but both are successful in probing james hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. so in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. lost horizon has a much stronger story than most musicals. it attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. one has to remember that lost horizon in 1973 was post cabaret. it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. lost horizon was an easy target for jaded critics. the expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. there were two targets to be hit, the producer, ross hunter and burt bacharach and the critics were out to get both of them. ross hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and lost horizon was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster airport that film was universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. for years airport was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. it was nominated for 11 academy awards including best picture. at the time, burt bacharach and hal david were the most successful songwriters in the country. the unabashed sentimentality of lost horizon hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like easy rider, midnight cowboy and the godfather. sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. today lost horizon can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. it's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. it's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. it changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? lost horizon '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. a lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation. As a pokémon fan i enjoyed this movie very much. it introduces new legendary pokémon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. i however do not expect those who are not pokémon fans to enjoy it(this includes most adults). some of the lines were corny, but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english. the animation was beautiful, although there were a couple parts that did not look good. and although the villain is kind of corny, i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains, and i guarantee you that they aren't all like this one. those who did not like it, i say to each his own, but pokémon fans will love it. I'm proud to say i'm a student at uw-milwaukee, where parts of the film were shot. yep, i recognize mitchell hall, where i took a film class, possibly the same course as fellow student smith.that's where i learned about \"american movie.\" our professor told us about it shortly before its release. to be sure, i was intrigued, but for some reason, i put off seeing it for several months(it must've done pretty well if it was still playing, at least in milwaukee).when i finally got around to seeing it, i thought it was an entertaining documentary. it's not a masterpiece-it goes on a bit too long-but i find mark's passion and commitment inspiring. i hope this film signals the beginnings of bigger and better things him. maybe his forthcoming \"northwestern\" will propel him to fortune. who knows?rating: *** (out of ****)108 min/released by sony pictures classics. This final voyager episode begins 23 years in the future. voyager has made it back home. in the many years it took to return tho, the vulcan tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. he carried a disease they were too late getting home to cure.captain janeway comes across aliens who have time travel technology. she realizes, there's a warp conduit in the delta quadrant that could bring voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and notify voyager. there's one problem. the conduit is deep inside borg space.janeway visits tuvok. he's like a child. he scribbles tho, obsessed, working on math problems or movie reviews or something, he's convinced are important somehow. in the institution, tuvok cries, asking for 'janeway' to please, please come back to him.janeway decides to commandeer a federation shuttle and equip it with weapons technology 20 years ahead of the borg, in the hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to guide voyager to the warp conduit.when she goes back in time and links up with voyager, janeway meets her younger self. the two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. the real-captain visits tuvok asking him if it's true he has a brain disorder. tuvok admits it's true, but it can't be cured by the facilities on the ship so he's kept it to himself.the young captain agrees to the older captains' plan. to increase their chances of success the older janeway plans to distract the borg with her shuttle craft. the borg actually capture janeway and her shuttle. the borg queen personally assimilates captain janeway. but janeway's expected this! the borg queen has assimilated a virus into herself that kills her. with the borg queen dead voyager makes it thru the warp conduit back to federation space. Clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this, but this one does not embarrass him. dirty harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance, there is no reason why you won't like him. he is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thinking, is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care.from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts, the character of the lead role always captivates the audience. in white hunter black heart, he is the crazy director, in \"in the line of fire\" he is the \"old 'un\" while here is the \"almost\" jobless with his job, that is to say he makes work for himself, doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation.based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all the \"no non-sense\" movie watchers. the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot. however, what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not, as it is far too obvious from the beginning. it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving. also, there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry. After finishing the zero woman series, i was looking forward to the female prisoner scorpion series; both based upon comics by tooru shinohara. unfortunately, i was not able to see them in order, as this is the third in the series.it starts great as the scorpion (meiko kaji) is escaping from the police. detective kondo (mikio narita) did manage to get a cuff on her, but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away. if that isn't bad enough, later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat.scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside. first, a local yakuza tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn't put out; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of tanida. but, they don't hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance.soon they are dropping like flies. some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder. the madam (reisen lee) turns herself in to avoid getting killed.the police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer. she's in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend (yayoi watanabe) has been supplying her with food. (the story o yuki (watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but only incidental to the movie.) they try to burn her out, but this is the scorpion, and she has some unfinished business.not the usual mix of sex and violence, this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout. It is more a subtle story of the fact that in indian household how most decisions are taken by the man, how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady, for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires, not to give the woman pleasure. and in such a type of scenario, women invariably have two choices, either to accept all this and take it into their own life, which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves, which makes a movie!fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option, which women choose for themselves, no sacrifice, not to serve anybody else, rather a decision for their own good. somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didn't find an acceptance in the indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self-expression, then the whole debate doesn't even arise. It is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change! as an added bonus, it is nice to see some local home boys from massachusetts making good in l.a. i hope this show will be a keeper. Following the brilliant \"goyôkiba\" (aka. \"hanzo the razor - sword of justice\", 1972) and its excellent (and even sleazier) sequel \"goyôkiba: kamisori hanzô jigoku zeme\" (aka. \"razor 2: the snare\", 1973), this \"goyôkiba: oni no hanzô yawahada koban\" aka. \"razor 3: who's got the gold\" is the third, and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the incorruptible samurai-constable hanzo 'the razor' ittami (brilliantly played by the great shintarô katsu), who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers. as a big fan of 70s exploitation cinema made in nippon, \"sword of justice\" became an instant favorite of mine, and i was therefore more than eager to find the sequels, and full of anticipation when i finally stumbled over them recently. while this third \"hanzo\" film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cult-cinema that no lover of japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss. \"who's got the gold\" is a bit tamer than the two foregoing hanzo films, but it is just as brilliantly comical and crudely humorous, and immediately starts out fabulously odd: the film begins, when hanzo's two assistants see a female ghost when fishing. having always wanted to sleep with a ghost, hanzo insists that his assistants lead him to the site of the occurrence... if that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience, i don't know what is. shintaro katsu, one of my personal favorite actors, is once again brilliant in the role of hanzo, a role that seems to have been written specifically for him. katsu is hanzo, the obstinate and fearless constable, who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors, and whose unique interrogation techniques include raping female suspects. the interrogated women than immediately fall for him, due to his sexual powers and enormous penis, which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual. i will not give away more about the plot in \"who's got the gold\", but i can assure that it is as cool as it sounds. the supporting performances are also very good, and, as in the predecessors, there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters. this is sadly the last film in the awesomely sleazy 'hanzo' series. if they had made 20 sequels more, i would have happily watched them all! the entire hanzo series is brilliant, and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors, it is definitely a must-see for all lovers of cult-cinema! oh how i wish they had made more sequels!. I'm not a massive disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! ok, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.great characters, phil harris stealing the show as thomas o'malley, but edgar the butler not far behind. the music is superb - my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to \"everybody wants to be cat\" this says it all. and \"thomas o'malley\" is just as enjoyable.i'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats! and yes, it does take a few of its cues from \"101 dalmations\", and maybe \"the lady and the tramp\" (it's been a long time since i've seen that, so i'm not going to compare them), and while \"101 dalmations\" is better in some ways, for me \"the aristocats\" is far more enjoyable. isn't that what these films are about? apart from \"peter pan\" (now that is a 10/10 film), this is my favourite disney film. my 7 year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film.superb!. I love paul mccartney. he is, in my oppinion, the greatest of all time. i could not, however, afford a ticket to his concert at the tacoma dome during the back in the u.s. tour. i was upset to say the least. then i found this dvd. it was almost as good as being there. paul is still the man and i will enjoy this for years to come. i do have one complaint. i would of like to hear all of hey jude.also paul is not dead.the single greatest concert dvd ever.***** out of *****. When i first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. i'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall. the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes. most of the attitudes came from soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then. i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. while he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. the two convicts he trusts most are jackson(mel winkler) and ben(james earl jones). the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass.this movie should have gotten more notoriety. however it's on dvd and worth the money.rayvyn. One of the many speculations about y2k was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on december 31, 1999. in `the book of life,' writer/director hal hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium armageddon, beginning with the return of jesus to earth on new year's eve, 99. the story examines the task of the son of god, who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the book of life (now contained in a mac laptop computer), in which there is also the names of the one-hundred and forty-four thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day. jesus (martin donovan), along with magdalena (p.j harvey), arrives in new york city to make the preparations necessary for carrying out his father's will, but he begins to have second thoughts; must he judge the living and the dead? do they deserve what must befall them? it is a cup he would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment, which gives encouragement to satan (thomas jay ryan) who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight, for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams. an artistically rendered, high concept film, hartley presents the story in an intelligent, thought provoking manner, taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it inoffensive even to the most ardent fundamentalist. the dialogue between jesus and satan is intriguing and stimulating, as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city. it's an engrossing meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of that which has been prophesied in the revelations of st. john in the apocalypse, the last book of the new testament. and there is logic in hartley's approach to the second coming; he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while employing altered film speeds which visually give the film an ethereal quality. christ inconspicuously wears a suit and tie, effectively blending in with the populace, while satan's attire is a bit more casual, his appearance somewhat scruffy; he sports a bruise above his left eye. donovan is well cast as jesus, lending a benevolent mien and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective. it is, of course, a unique portrayal of the saviour, and possibly the best since max von sydow's in `the greatest story ever told.' he successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility, of serenity, that is the essence at the very core of the character. and ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the prince of darkness; he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch. his eyes are darkly penetrating, a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating stares. he's the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you. it's a memorable performance that contrasts so well with donovan's portrayal of jesus. the supporting cast includes martin pfeffercorn (martyr), miho nikaido (edie), dave simonds (dave), d.j. mendel (lawyer), james urbaniak (true believer), katreen hardt (lawyer's assistant) and anna kohler (hotel clerk). in his own, inimitable style, with `the book of life,' hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting, entertaining and truly unique. he has a way of capturing life as it is just off center, a method which works especially well with a film like this. comparatively short for a feature film (running time of 63 minutes), it nevertheless is one of hartley's best, and more than worth the price of admission. it's a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have tucked away in a corner of your mind for later. and that is part of the attraction of this film; it makes you realize that `later' most likely is now. i rate this one 9/10. I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the best one to tell this story through influence. most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a great movie with even better music. the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art. Well, magic works in mysterious ways. this movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense. even if it had something of a theater-play (almost everything happens in the cell) it never got boring and it was acted very well. in the tradition of \"cube\" you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal, you developed some sympathy with some of them, only to change your mind by the twists the story takes. some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air. altogether intense and entertaining and as i didn't expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!. This cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, spiderman improves in both departments. it also features the voice of stan lee, the creator of spiderman comics.as you'd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can. he does more than spin webs. in fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. when he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. spidey has his hands full as he battles venom, rhino, mysterio, scorpion, and dr. octopus to name a few. look for captain america in a cameo.most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. if you're a real marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. better luck in \"spiderman 2.\" my evaluation: 9 out of 10. ****spoilers**** powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as sacrifice their best friends and family members and not realize what monsters that they are by doing it. until like in the case of bull-like gypo noland, victor mclaglen, it's too much too late.it's 1922 and the hight of the black & tan irish revolt against the mighty british empire with the tans, british occupying troops, on the lookout for wanted irish republican rebel frankie mcphillip, wallace ford, wanted for the killing of a briish soldier. gypo a good, really the best, friend of the fugitive mcphillip is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend katie, margot grahame, forced to turn tricks in the dublin red-light district in order to pay her rent.after an outraged gypo worked over a potential john who want's to spend a few hours with katie, for a shilling or two, an angry katie tells the not so bright gyro that he's preventing her for supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has , her body. katie also tells gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what a desperate situation that she's in. telling the mind-numbed gypo that it would only cost ten pound sterling for her to go to america, and get out of the poverty of ireland, gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend frankie mcphillip that he just saw announcing a reward of 20 pound sterling. thats enough money for both him and kaite to travel to america.gypo going to a local dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is startled to run into his friend frankie mcphillip. frankie tells him that he snuck into dublin to see both his mother mrs. mcphillip and sister mary, una o'connor & heather angel, and if he can make sure that everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his irish republican unit outside the city.all gypo can see in frankie's face is the 20 pound sterling reward for him being turned into the police! without as much of a second thought, after he assured frankie that everything is all right, gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and tan shootout in his moms house.with the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling, much like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless gypo who takes it and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him. you can see in the police chief's face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for gypo's betrayal of his friend frankie mcphillip. even though he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the british empire. that's how low traitors or informers are held even by those whom they secretly work for.gypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after his betrayal of frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind. gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend katie, pointing a finger and implicating him in frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the british authorities. gypo's guilty mind has him getting himself royally and gloriously drunk, on the reward money, that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his irish republican army colleagues, who had the almost dead drunk and slobbering gypo on trial, the money was just about gone in his partying drinking and whoring.whatever good feelings, if that's possible, that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation, in order to keep from getting shot, he falsely implicate an innocent man mulligan, donald meek, in his crime of informing on his friend frankie mcphillip. which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non other then the guilt-ridden gypo himself. the dye is then cast as straws are drawn for who would be the one to put a bullet in gypo's head for the final gut spilling chapter of this heart wrenching and unforgettable crime & punishment classic. The wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british pow's during world war ii. it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues leo genn. anthony steele and david tomlinson (later george banks in mary poppins) are marvelous as the two heroes. the direction is taut and fast-moving throughout. highly recommended. I was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. some people were looking for a plot??? ok, when this video came out over a decade ago, i watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. it's not a movie. it doesn't have a plot, nor a central storyline. it's a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-form videos, all of them rather smartly or creatively done. michael jackson may be considered a freak these days, but, after all, this was the man who gave us thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with billie jean and beat it. with moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self-parody (the \"badder\" sequence). and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there, this video came out just a tad before he became a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances on film. and, imho, i think the smooth criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point!. I have never read a jacqueline susann novel, but i have also seen valley of the dolls, based on another of her books. on both occasions i thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). the reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. and in this aspect the love machine offers quite a lot. the set design fits the story perfectly. and all the characters fit in, too. they're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture. they are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this movie i wouldn't want it any different.david hemmings reprises the role he played in antonioni's blow up. and it's more than a rip-off. he's a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed. robert ryan reprises the role he played in max ophül's caught, he is smith ohlrig all over again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. it's possible ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. whatever happened, it fits the picture. dyan cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!), she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the hemmings character with a academy award statuette.the title, the love machine, is, of course, meant ironically. robin stone is a kind of a barry lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the movie is slightly kubrickysh). that he chooses a tv station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. he sees love (meaning sexual favors) merely as a means for personal advancement. there are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. homosexuality is treated very casually, probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period. the open cynicism of the tv executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like a face in the crowd or network or truman show. they are producing crap, they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it.i did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following, provided it's given the chance (meaning a dvd release). Wonderfully put together..i wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. it was great..the film wasn't long enough..i would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...i am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't; actually its the hetero's that we need to look into..this film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for that..i really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. thank you s much for allowing this film to exist. Although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion a great movie. it's great campy fun with the beautiful stuart townsend as lestat. he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and lestat is most definitely about looking good. he moves like the predator i always imagined lestat would have. the visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. it's not interview with the vampire, so don't try to compare the two. interview is louis' story. this is a cut and paste version of lestat's. in any case, i highly recommend. I thought this film was just about perfect. the descriptions/summaries you'll read about this movie don't do it justice. the plot just does not sound very interesting, but it is. just rent it and you will not be sorry!!. At times, this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film. while carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. it's one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. i try not to compare it to the book  which i've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. it's almost as if kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening. and it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made, as well as one of the greatest horror films.what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time. it's the destruction of jack torrence. some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film, given his past roles and his appearance. i disagree. we know he's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and jack's appearance only furthers this notion. but it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. he's calm, quiet, patient. he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family. and with a wife and son as irritating as his, it's a small wonder that he manages to do so. but once he gets to the overlook, he changes. he becomes irritable, angry, on edge. the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing, and he utterly loses it, telling her to \"leave him the f*** alone\". this is the first f-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system. from then on, all bets are off.another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film. we're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that he may as well be talking to himself. but what of the other characters? wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while danny connects with the place almost immediately. his psychic powers are not in question  how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel?  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness? it's easy to claim that jack merely loses it, being trapped in a hotel with his family, and wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of danny? it appears that his body is taken over by tony, but how do we know for sure? none of these characters are reliable witnesses. hallorann probably would be, and he warns of the dangers in 237, but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook (a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). and that final shot. has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? has jack really been there before? or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? when talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson. shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose, to give jack's character more of a reason to snap  and danny lloyd is no better, but jack is a powerhouse. part method, part improvisation, he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing. for better or for worse, he's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid or nagging wife. we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be able to do whatever we want. who cares if it's haunted? of course, the technical aspects are terrific. kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. the use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. and don't even get me started on that score. i don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself.i know king doesn't like this film, but king's input on cinema is nothing to brag about. as great of a novel writer he may be, his screenplays are terrible, and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. this is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it doesn't need to be, and it really shouldn't. part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material. kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. if only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. and it's got everything else on top of that. Scream was wes craven's last decent thriller. since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night, including the disappointment of the scream sequels. perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him, so that when it came time for supper, he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo. finally, after who knows how many bad movies later, he gives us a delicious, ruthless, gripping, chilling suspense thriller with red eye.rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel. then she meets jackson ripner (cillian murphy, batman beyond) at the airport, who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze. what she doesn't know is he already knows her. and he also knows her father, who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet jackson's demands- to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination.you're probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes. although this is a good old fashioned thriller, that's the beauty of it. no special effects. no cheap make up. just classic suspense. you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position.as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance. it's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry, but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it. cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking, so even if the trailer didn't reveal it, his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn't so surprising. perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire transforming into evil relentless madman. nevertheless, cillian murphy, after his true identity is established, played the role so solidly you'd really want him to die, or at least get his ass kicked.don't overlook this feature. there are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven's recent pictures. if not for the you, do it for all the times you'll see your girlfriend, or boyfriend, or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you. wes finally gets it right. aside from his trademark mastery in suspense, red eye is not without its humor as mcadams' replacement cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order. it was a relief that red eye wasn't a disappointment. instead you'll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance, murphy look creepier by the minute, and craven craft a classic traditional thriller. a flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of craven's renaissance had it arrived right after scream. What this movie is not: cool, entertainingwhat this movie is: visually interesting, difficult to get through, intentionali feel that this movie puts the viewer (if he or she is willing) through a clip of time where they experience a world without language. much like how animals must experience the world. you don't really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what \"feels\" like real time.consistently, it goes on much longer than is comfortable. this movie could be edited down to a 20 minute short and it would be a totally different movie. it would be cool and entertaining, but the experience would be lost. i have seen a lot of cool movies, but i have never experienced one like this. if you can get your head in the right place for this one, you should be able to really appreciate (but likely not \"enjoy\") what they accomplished here. 10 out of 10. Overall, i agree wholly with ebert's review. in a sense, i feel that i should not even be commenting since it is so much a vet's movie and i am not a vet (i was a resister). the flaw is that martha is badly underdeveloped and does not act consistently. my guess is that stephen metcalfe is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character. I have watched grand champion all the way through at least twice now. i enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. it is refreshing to see a g rated movie. this is a feel good movie. the story is mostly from the view of the children. the interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting. i recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film. if you liked the little rascals, you will probably enjoy this. i viewed this movie on cable. either on encore or showtime family. this is not a movie that i would have gone to see at the theatre. but, i only go to the theatre for the effects of the big screen, so most comedies, romantic films, or dramas i do not go for big screen-i wait for tv/cable edition. get your kids together, pop some popcorn and enjoy!. My all-time favorite movie. oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. the screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment. it is josie lawrence's best work by far, and transformed my opinion of joan plowright. having watched this movie at least 50 times, i can find no fault in it. the music, by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel. I also saw the last stop at the moving pictures film festival in prince george. i have to confess, the only reason i went to see it is because i am a huge callum keith rennie fan. and he didn't let me down. he gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole movie.the movie itself is the usual 'lots of bad people trapped in a snow storm together' storyline, but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing. the characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well. the only problems i had with the cast was rose mcgowan. she was so cold throughout the movie that we didn't get any idea of her character's personality or motivations. other than her and a few small problems with continuity, this was a well-written, well acted thriller. Coming of age movies are quite usual these days. for 1980, \"foxes\" really gives its meaning. jodie foster plays her character straight out. ever since she did \"taxi driver\" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. she's jeanie, a high schooler who has plenty of guts, and seems to get out of any situation she's in. scott baio plays brad way before chachi on \"happy days\". he's deemed immature by the other girls. cherie currie is annie, hangs with the wrong crowd, chased by her policeman father. jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand. exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous. annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted. reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident. and one gets married to a much older man. growing up isn't easy, sometimes we got to explore life how it is. in reality, you got to be careful about the people surrounding you. for me, i was my own person, and i tend to stay that way! great music, great plot, this movie's a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!. My girlfriend and i saw this movie when it was originally released. the controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. we were close to the same age as paul and michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. we were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. this movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have. i still remember sitting in the movie theater with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic (albiet syrupy) final scenes. Wow, don't watch this thinking it's going to be a relaxing circus evening! it will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. circus has never been more colourful, more exciting and more breathtaking! the whole concept is truely amazing. you're taken into the world of cirque du soleil and are left with a thousand thoughts when you leave. there's only one thing left to do: get the cd and/or dvd and live through it again and again and again. get addicted! it's well worth it! must be next to the most beautiful thing on earth and one of cirque du soleil's best programmes. I was very surprised to learn that goldie hawn won an oscar for this film. she seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54(!) year old bergman in the scenes where they are side by side. if it had been written today, i think that bergman and the young man ivan would have wound up together (ingrid is so much hotter than goldie...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by matthau and hawn would be left out in the cold. but it was written at the end of 60's and feels like plaza suite or barefoot in the park. however, matthau's one-liners, hawn's innocence and bergman's classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch. I thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy's bodacious bod. if you don't expect anything else, such as clever plot twists and believable character development, you won't be disappointed. consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people, especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy' (suzanna arquette, who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter).mandy's face is a little too perfect, but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire, up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness, a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips, and splendidly configured legs, right down to her feet. (there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio).and no flat butt to boot, which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres'. mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no. 2, but from all i could see from her bikini shots, she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it.mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy's girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones. her bisexual nature (allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no. 2, who also happened to be her mother's lover) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses (always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason).mandy's uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse. if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress, i'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages, especially italian and spanish - and maybe french, although i don't know if they would go for her type. but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic, and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground.vambo drule. Lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because rupert grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. julie walters it was perfect too. i think that rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. rupert have a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor, so it deserves that and more. he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an oscar academy award. there are some actors that do not act very well but have a oscar anyway. it does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful. When a movie shocks you with it's disturbing, brooding atmosphere, and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography, you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat, masterpiece of a film. although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time. i say, proudly, that i am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. movies like breakdown and the missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think \"holy crap, that could happen to me\", and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. because i am only 21, i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds, jon voight and ned beatty, albeit i am familiar with them, i didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long. i must say, after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time, i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. burt renyolds plays lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water. renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo. witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers, drew and bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight, once again i have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike renyolds, i have quite liked voight's acting (and i don't regard anaconda when i say that), for example the national treasure movies. voight plays ed, whom, like lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks lewis' machismo. the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous \"duelling banjo's\" at the start of the film with ronny cox's character drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. as with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. the film's cinematics do not let up, and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film. in wrapping up, deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history. This short movie intends to focus on one issue sociologically known as cultured shock. the film presents the condition of average romanian in democratic romania who finds out that the life and the problems are not different from communist period, and if you want something, you must bribe around to get it.so, our main character is fired after a long while, he is around 50 and needs to get a similar job, but the only job available is one inferior. he is forced to take it because the lack of money.my opinion is that you have to live in romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems. This movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience. i think that a lot of people get caught up in leland's apparent mental illness as the storyline, but i was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions. much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad, which is a little cliché, but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have, whether you see the bad everywhere like leland, or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just isn't going to work no matter how bad you want it to. this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie i've seen, and it is as depressing a movie as it is good. I am afraid i will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain flabbergasted that this film has still not ( sept 2007 ) been issued on dvd. it's one of those mysteries that makes the mind boggle, especially when you consider the amount of dvd's available today containing material that should have been binned years ago. still i have an excellent digital vhs copy in english with subtitles and nicam stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film. as to the film itself, this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a european ). how true the film fits in with the reality in burma i have no idea, indeed, that is less important, the essential thing is that entertainment-wise, it is a success. one soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and i admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene. it's a shame we hear so little about countries such as burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country. has the situation changed since 1995 ? the events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding \"no\" and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !. After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. what is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. there is no preaching. life goes on. it is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. these are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. we all went to school with kids like these. we are being numbed by fiction-/movie-/tv-/news-based reality/invention.feck's (dennis hopper the great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie.there have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film. amen. I liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein. carradine is much more passable & his acting isn't as ridiculous & overboard as in hof. the actors deliver solid enough performances. the subplots (eg the monster, the village mobsters, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse etc ) are mixed in well, so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof. better run than the stitched-together hof. the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof. the doctor is very good. as well, lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman. worth watching twice. a classic universal horror with that typical 1940's, long lost flair. especially good is the doctor's performance before/after his blood had been contaminated with dracula's. After some difficulty, johnny yuma arrives at his ailing uncle's ranch to take over day to day operations, only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold-digger wife and the woman's vicious brother.good production values, a likable performance by mark damon, and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining, if not exceptionally deep, above average addition to the spaghetti western genre.co-star rosalba neri is one of the hottest european babes ever to grace the screen. here she's absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted user (and abuser) of weak men.damon and neri appeared together in at least one other picture, the devil's wedding night, a pretty good horror movie that's of particular interest for those of you that want to see what's underneath rosalba's dresses. \"the egyptian\" is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, the pharaoh akhnaton, who, thirteen centuries before christ attempted to introduce a monotheistic religion, atenism, to ancient egypt. the main character, however, is not akhnaton but rather the fictitious sinuhe. as a baby, sinuhe is found mysteriously floating in a basket on the river nile and adopted by the physician senmut and his wife. when he grows to manhood, he follows his adopted father into the medical profession, initially working (as his father did) among the poor of the city, but he comes to prominence after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier horemheb, save the pharaoh's life while on a hunting expedition in the desert. sinuhe is appointed court physician, but becomes obsessed with the babylonian courtesan nefer. sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win her love, but is also disgraced when his neglect of his duties means that he is unable to save the life of akhnaton's daughter.sinuhe flees into exile, where he achieves success as a healer in neighbouring countries, but returns to egypt when he learns of a hittite plot to invade. although akhnaton readily forgives him for his previous offences, sinuhe finds the country in turmoil. the pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheistic faith, and he is too pacific by nature to take any steps to confront the hittite threat. sinuhe becomes embroiled in a plot by horemheb, now the general of the egyptian army, and akhnaton's sister princess baketamon to overthrow the pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch.the film's weaknesses arise mostly from its two romantic subplots. in the course of the film, sinuhe is revealed as the long-lost son of the previous pharaoh and half-brother to akhnaton and baketamon. it might therefore surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him; marriage between brothers and sisters were not necessarily considered as incestuous by the standards of egyptian royalty, but the standards of 1950s cinema audiences were generally less liberal on this point. in any case, the horemheb-baketamon-sinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and detracts from baketamon's role in the film, that of the voice of cold-eyed, cynical realpolitik.the nefer subplot, which takes up most of the first hour of the film, is overwritten and excessively melodramatic. nefer is morally worthless but fascinating, and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also great dramatic skill to make her credible, especially as nefer achieves the difficult task of winning sinuhe away from a woman as lovely as jean simmons (who plays merit, sinuhe's rival for her affections). it is therefore unfortunate that the role went to an actress as comically inept as bella darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the mistress of the producer, darryl f. zanuck. darvi was not only a wooden actress, but also spoke with a thick foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible by a lisp. she was not even particularly attractive by comparison with the two legendary hollywood beauties in the film, simmons and gene tierney who plays baketamon.the film is better when it concentrates on its main political and religious themes. the other actors are better than darvi, although peter ustinov as sinuhe's servant kaptah makes the same mistake as in \"spartacus\", that of trying to bring comic relief into a film that does not need it. his voice, anyway, was far too patrician for a \"comic servant\" role.edmund purdom, a little-known british actor, was thrust into the main role when marlon brando pulled out at the last minute, but more than adequately fills the great man's shoes, even though his style of acting was quite different. he copes well with the challenge of showing the changes in sinuhe's character, from unworldly idealist, to lovesick fool, to embittered cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. victor mature was never the most expressive of actors, but he is well-suited to the role of horemheb, a practical, down-to-earth man of action. he is better here than he was in his other epic from 1954, \"demetrius and the gladiators\". simmons is luminously beautiful as merit.michael wilding (hitherto best known to me as the second mr elizabeth taylor) plays akhnaton as a would-be philosopher-king who ends as a sort of holy fool. his inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice which lend him an air of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. although aten had more in common with the supreme being of the deists than with the old testament jehovah or the trinitarian christian god, there is a quite deliberate attempt to draw parallels between atenism and christianity. in the film the atenist symbol is the \"ankh\", doubtless chosen because of its resemblance to a cross, but in reality it was a common egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique to atenism. akhnaton's language often has a biblical ring to it; his comparison of himself to \"wind whistling in the desert\" recalls john the baptist's \"voice crying in the wilderness\" (hence the title of this review). sinuhe's finding in the river parallels the old testament story of moses.at the end of the film sinuhe, who has become the inheritor of the spirit of the dead akhnaton, achieves a moral greatness of his own. the message of the film is that, while we may need practical men of action like horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are prepared to ask the question \"why?\" for all its faults, \"the egyptian\" is a film which is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 7/10. It's a shame that asterix and his buddy obelix do not get the world wide recognition that other cartoon comic characters get.this is another funny asterix cartoon jammed with entertainment. the animation is excellent and the voice characterization good, even if the synchronization is a little out. the music and score fit well within the story and the slotting in of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch.the running time seems short and while it's not the best asterix story or the most developed cartoon, it's good clean fun. the modern (disney like) animation will capture children, asterix fans and new comers... enjoy the gaul adventure!. Excellent film from thaddeus o'sullivan featuring strong performances from a host of british and irish actors. the film deals well with a thorny subject matter, and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of 1970s belfast. surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. on one hand, it shows a young catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles. on the other it deals with a loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence. very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. don't be expecting any laughs, though. 7 out of 10. Of course i'm a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen.i was at camp pendleton undergoing infantry training when webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. it took about two or three days as best i can recall.webb and don dubbins were serious and businesslike.during the filming of our short scene--which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old--webb was very conscientious about getting things (marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception--that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses. never happen for a host of reasons.i have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their papaw when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force (no brag, just fact).what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles. that was before i realized that dis have to have some acting genes to get their job done. the only film i've seen since that is the equal of the di is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language. when the di was made, cursing wasn't allowed on screen. despite the lack of profanity, it's still a great movie to rent.ooooo-rahhhhhh!!!!!semper fi, do or die. This isn't a bad tv movie. shtrafbat is short for shtrafnoy batallion, which means penal batallion. such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the soviet union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war. these battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. they were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret, or much honor, on the part of military. they were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties. the ones who refused to fight were executed on sight. needless to say, their lives sucked.there were some very nice performances by the cast, especially by yuri stepanov who played antip, aleksandr bashirov who played stirah, and roman madyanov who played major kharchenko. however the series isn't really that addictive, in part because it's too long, it could've a lot shorter and as effective.although it's about war, shtrafbat has very mild violence and pretty much no gore. it relies solely on the actors to make it work, and after all, it's a tv series, so the producers didn't want to scare off the viewers and the sponsors.shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the soviet regime, and explaines why so many men chose to fight the nazis instead of joining them. personally i'd rather be a fascist then a communist given the circumstances presented in the film. one character explains that the soviets stripped his farm clean and his family died of starvation. out of anger he burned it down which got him arrested for destroying kolhoz property and he ended up in the penal battalion as a criminal. antip reminisced on how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. both men explained that they fought for their motherland, rather than the for the soviets.the penal battalion had one marine(naval infantry) who raped a girl, killing his comrade in the prosess, threatened his other comrade to keep his mouth shut about both ordeals, and then feigned injury when it came to fighting. on top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame. i imagine if enough marines watched this movie they'd pick up banners and riot on the streets calling for a boycott or an official apology from the producers.to say the least, i'd recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former soviet union or world war ii. i don't think i wasted 500+ minutes of my life. I read the other comments here about this movie before watching it. if you've read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. i really don't understand that. i admit that it is far too long (it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit). the music is often inappropriate. but, strong performances by ford and thomas are indeed enough to carry this. with all his fame as a movie star, i'd forgotten that harrison ford really can act! this role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable. i find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception. thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception. her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous. this movie is never going to be on anybody's list of great flicks, but it isn't that bad. i'm glad that i waited to see it on video, but it is worth the $3 or $4. Leon was fantastic as always, this time playing little richard in his early years. the movie showed a fully fleshed out little richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great music. my only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt - i was hoping for a 2-parter!. Eleven different film makers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the wtc attack. this is one of the best effort you will see in any film. films like this are rarely made and appreciated. this film tries to touch every possible core of wtc. here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique.there is the story from samira makhmalbaf (iran) where somewhere in iran people are preparing for the attacks from america. there a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about innocent people being killed in wtc massacre. then comes a story from youssef chahine (egypt) where a film maker comes across face-to-face conversation with a dead soldier in the wtc attack and a dead hard core terrorist who was involved in wtc attack. then we see a story from idrissa ouedraogo (burkina faso) where a group of five innocent children's sees osama bin laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from america. then we see the story from alejandro gozalez inarritu (mexico) where you see a black screen and slowly you see the real footage of wtc buildings coming down. and the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives. the other most important story is from mira nair (india) where a mother is struggling to get respect for her dead son whose name is falsely trapped in wtc massacre! after september 11 attack, our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world.. first is world trade centre and the second is osama! this film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it.i will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of home dvd collection. definitely worth every penny you spend. but please don't expect anything more apart from films in this dvd. there is of course filmographies of the film makers but no extra features. Finally, the uncut version of \"baby face\" surfaces and from what source? the library of congress. the restored four minutes, snippets here and there, make for a much better film. we now know that baby face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age. another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold, calculating exterior.barbara stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of lily powers (notice the moniker), a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power, cunning, and revenge, yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for, a very difficult portrayal to make convincing. barbara stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top (literally), she still has good in her heart--note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as chico (the marvelous actress theresa harris) and the old philosopher. and though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful, those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her.lily powers fails to understand, at first, that emotions are difficult to ride, that it's easy to lose control. one possible result is death. hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral, and it's a cold lonely location.a word should be said about the philosophy of friedrich nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in \"baby face\" by the elderly philosopher who befriends lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man. \"baby face\" was released the same year adolf hitler came to power in germany. though it's highly unlikely that the semi-literate hitler understood much about nietzsche, he considered himself a nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings. \"baby face\" serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of nietzsche's will to power concept, especially in the final scenes.although \"you've got the cutest little baby face.\" is apropos as a theme for \"baby face,\" an even more telling and applicable melody is w. c. handy's \"st. louis blues\" played throughout the film, especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes. \"st. louis blues\" is also used wisely toward the end as lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values. chico is singing a raw, salacious version of \"st. louis blues\" when lily, now disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her to stop.the restored version of \"baby face\" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new hollywood release. by all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy. Pola x is a beautiful adaption of herman melville's 'pierre; or, the ambiguities'. the comments on here surprise me, it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction. the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film - a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion. the story is of pierre's downfall - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - which is overtly demonstrated in his features, demeanour and idiolect. the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen, and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epic.i can't stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching, as i did, with an open mind. you will, i hope, be rewarded in the same way that i was. i felt on edge and nervous from around the half-hour mark, however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense. it will leave you with 1,000 thoughts, each of them at once troublesome and thrilling. i know i'm gushing here, but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film. it's the best i've seen all year. Saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene. a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars. only wish i could find it again! would certainly buy/view it if i could. please, somebody, bring it back. fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii, and his leading ladies, joan leslie, and especially june haver were beautiful and charming. it was a musical, but also romantic, funny, and clever. this was my favorite movie starring june haver, although i always liked her. her dazzling smile lit up the screen, and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film. the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles. a well-balanced and light-hearted film; only wish we had more like it!. Don't even try to figure out the logic of this story. but do ride along with 10-year-old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed. more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion! nothing makes sense, yet it's impossible to stop watching motorama! now, where can i find that 'r'????. I love this movie, but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid.the fateful game took place in 1972. that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. but almost all of the music played at the dances etc. is from the 1950s and very early 1960s.having just attended my 30th high school reunion, i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music.i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically. but it wasn't completely bereft, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film.this was a bad director and/or producer decision. I've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy. having been born too late to see 'hair' in its contemporary setting, i have just been familiar with the uk and broadway cast recordings for many years; and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still, great fun.the film. it drops some of the songs (the bed, my conviction, frank mills) and cuts others (walking in space). however, what is left is presented very well indeed. all the singers and dancers are excellent, and the key performers (especially treat williams as berger, beverley d'angelo as sheila, john savage as claude) are memorable.as a hippy celebration and anthem, 'hair' manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late. it was no longer the era of peace, love, and biba, but the time of punk rock ... although watching this film now, in the time of iraqi problems, gives a new resonance to the vietnam issues of the 1960s.milos forman, who also made 'amadeus', did a good job on directing. in its scope and feel it reminds me of norman jewison's 'jesus christ superstar', especially with the joy of the 'aquarius' scene and the intimacy of 'easy to be hard'.i really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era. Taken in the context of the time it was made, i found this a worthwhile movie. while the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer. in addition, i found spotting actors i knew a real pleasure. who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad? i'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. as to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to andrew jackson's right hand man peavey. the perfect touch of comedy. well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of america, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy. For me, the best & most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing i know nothing about. american movie is a perfect example of just such a gem. watching tv late one evening, i spotted the one & only good review among the dross - thankfully i settled in for a real treat. american movie is a documentary following the unforgettable mark borchardt (pronounced \"orchard\", i believe), a highly articulate & charismatic wisconson lad, as he struggles to write, direct and produce \"midwestern\", a gritty, low-budget horror movie on which he has been working for years. in mark we discover a young man filled with contrast. his appearance is of the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bum-fluff mustache, '80s heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. to camera however, mark reveals startling wit & insight as he philosophizes upon life, love, movies & the american way. as the movie unfolds, it sadly becomes clear that mark's lack of discipline & heavy drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. american movie is a charming watch, filled with hilarious moments & vivid characters. chief among these is mark's lovable buddy mike schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner who, having conquered an addiction to scratch cards, is now dependent on soda pop. i absolutely loved american movie. it generates real empathy between the viewer & principal characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. i would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. This is at least very close to a perfect video publication. messianic metal group, dinosaurs of rock n' roll, biggest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and reminisces band's past - what more do we need?video starts from \"war pigs\" and ends to \"paranoid\" and in the middle all the greatest and most significant classics of the original line-up are included: \"electric funeral\", \"sweet leaf\", \"after forever\", \"iron man\", \"children of the grave\"...and of course my personal favourite \"into the void\", i'm glad they didn't leave it out. well, how could they?still, this video is more than just the music. ozzy osbourne, tony iommi, geezer butler and bill ward goes over the group's colorful history. only thing that slightly bothers me is when a live song is being interrupted with bits of interview. for example, is it that necessary to inform how the song \"n.i.b.\" got it's name, right in the middle of it - one on top of the other? i doubt. it's still a small flaw so it's not too big deal.band members also laze around in chairs and chat together: pleasant material for a sabbath fan! i admit i have difficulties of following what ozzy osbourne is muttering but it's just amusing. i had a privilege to participate when \"the last supper tour\" entered finland and for me personally this video is an ideal way to recall that magnificent show. A great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store. after he's done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he'll be transferring soon. bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy...and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals. animals like say, a certain rabbit. this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer. i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940's. it still remains as funny nearly 60+ years later. this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2.my grade: a-. Let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice, i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie. those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears. i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors. the acting was better than average, but the plot held no surprises. they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation. now as to the historical errors, if you call them that, the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april, then capt. pike, jim kirk, etc.. according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that's the reason a prime directive was created) but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series. i hope the plots will get deeper, and then special effects can take a backseat. This game ranks above all so far. i had the honor of playing mine on ps2 so the graphics were really good. the voice acting was above standard. the difficulty level is just right. wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion. the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn't expecting. the only rating this game deserves is great. It could have been a better film. it does drag at points, and the central story shifts from boyer completing his mission to boyer avenging wanda hendrix's death, but graham greene is an author who is really hard to spoil. his stories are all morality tales, due to his own considerations of catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world view), and the human condition.boyer is luis denard, a well-known concert pianist, who has sided with the republicans in the spanish civil war. he has been sent to england to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed. unfortunately for denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the falagists of spain. in particular katina paxinou (mrs. melendez) a grim boarding house keeper, and peter lorre (mr. contreras) a teacher of an \"esperanto\" type international language. wanda hendrix is the drudge of a girl (else) who works for mrs. melendez. the local diplomat, licata (victor francken) is already a willing associate of the falangists.the brits (holmes herbert, miles mander, and best - if not worst - of the lot, george coulouris) don't give much hope to boyer's cause (which he soon grasps may be britain's before long). herbert and mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the ramsay macdonald's and stanley baldwin's governments during the civil war. coulouris here is a typical col. blimp type - always impeccable in his native english diction, he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general.the one ray of hope is lauren bacall (rose cullen), here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she can't really. she's an aristocrat - the daughter of a press lord. it was bacall's second film, and (sad to say) almost sank her long career. she does act well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with humphrey bogart and being directed by howard hawks. boyer is a fine actor, but he's not bogie, and herman shumlin is not hawks. her next film returned her to bogie and hawks again, and her star resumed it's ascendancy.it's a bleak film (as was the novel). boyer's mission never succeeds, as he has too many hidden foes all over the place. but the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives.with dan seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of katina paxinou (and the man who destroys her). it is well worth watching to catch the warner's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction. This is marvelous movie, about a soul of ale. this is a journey to ale's heart. i found it fascinating. the director did a great job. he makes the scenes talk. especially on the silent scenes. the window of ale is a great one. an the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes i have seen. apart from directing. it has been a quite time i did not watch a movie about a soul. as a philosopher i can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul. so as ale's soul. as living in turkey i do not care about the other side of ny. this is a universal scene you can see everywhere in the world. as to my opinion more universal than every other thing. do not miss this film. otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. if you have one. baris.sentuna. I was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of 'scoop' last night. full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause. i didn't speak to anyone who disliked 'scoop' although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film. they were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.'scoop' is a quickly paced murder mystery. a young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose. plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman.'scoop' isn't a bad addition to the woody allen filmography. it isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp. i'd say it fits quite comfortably into being an average woody allen film, right in the middle of the pack. if you're a woody allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself. if you're indifferent to his work then 'scoop' might be enough to get you interested in seeing more. i don't think that anyone who dislikes his style of film-making and acting are going to change their mind. woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film. while potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words, woody allen fans know what to expect.very good performances all around in my opinion although i found myself missing ian mcshane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough. hugh jackman is great as the charming nobleman and i think woody allen has found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson. i think that with 'match point' this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that woody gives her. could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! i'm glad i saw the movie and definitely recommend it. more sophisticated comedy than movies like 'scary movie 4' so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former, 'scoop' probably isn't for you. if, on the other hand, you like a touch of class, sophistication and fun, 'scoop' is for you. probably not the woody allen film i'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try. Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of black sabbath have not lost a thing. in this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including \"n.i.b.\", \"war pigs\", and \"paranoid\".also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. the comments of ozzy, tony iommi, geezer butler, and bill ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.a must-see for all sabbath and ozzy fans. I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old. only \"the treasure of the sierra madre\" holds up this well, performance-wise. as someone that has seen heroin addiction first-hand, i was shocked at how realistic this film was. frank sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic, and heart wrenching. otto preminger's direction is perfect for the film, with long takes and a very mobile camera.kim novak's performance is good, as is eleanor parker's. in fact, the entire supporting cast works very well, with understated performances, as befitting this film's style. the documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date. highly recommended.8.0 out of 10. A young man named court is loved by everyone. his painful bloody death brings everyone closer. you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie. whether predictable or not, and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs, this is a moving story, full of milieu and sensuality.one other thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible. but the elements for this are set up subtly. note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field. note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves. he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment. to this day, tractors are pretty dangerous. This show is totally worth watching. it has the best cast of talent i have seen in a very long time. the premise of the show is unique and fresh ( i guess the executives at abc are not used too that, as it was not another reality show). however this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines. i am probably not in the age group they expect to like the show, as i am in my forty's, but a lot of my friends also loved it (late 30's - mid 40's) and are dying for quality shows with talented cast members. i do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience. i believe that given more time this show would have done very well. once again abc is not giving a show with real potential a real chance. with so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it! they need to give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and gain an audience. i really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode. i have been watching the episodes on abc videos and the show keeps getting better and better. although i think they owe us one more episode (number 13?). we want to watch what we can! bombard abc with emails and letters and see if its possible to save this show from extinction. it certainly worked for jerico. some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them. sign the online petition to abc at: http://www.petitiononline.com/gh1215/petition.html. A fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth. (things must be pretty bad back on mars.) two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash. whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy's pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner.the diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning. now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus, although he didn't notice who they were. the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed. one of them is an alien, but which one? all of them are suspect. there's the crazy old man (jack elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit. there's a blustering businessman who must get to boston (john hoyt). a young couple on their honeymoon. (execrable performance by the husband, ron kipling.) except for the couples, nobody has noticed anyone else. and even the couples are suspicious of each other. bride to newly minted husband: \"i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin.\" the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason, the lights go on and off, the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously.it's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle. there is no discernible \"depth\" to it. it's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens. it's not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses.i always enjoy it when it's on. it's especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm's version of shakespeare's play. and here he is -- with three arms.oops. Ronald colman gives a terrific performance as a stage actor who really gets into his work. when he plays othello on the stage he takes on the persona with dire results. good film with a great supporting cast. well worth watching. I saw this film (it's english title is \"who's singing over there?\") at the 1980 montreal international film festival. it won raves then... and disappeared. a terrible shame. it is brilliant. sublime, ridiculous, sad, and extremely funny. the script is a work of art. it's been 19 years and i've seen only a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality. Recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co-operation of real life persons; that in itself is an eye catcher. yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and i found myself engrossed throughout.due in no small way to the crisp, thoughtful and interesting dialogue.the film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical \"legends\" who formerly composed together then seperated.the film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial \"split\". what is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play,faults and all, that this viewer at least was left believing i was witnessing a true event in almost every detail. the great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about \"two of us\" talking can make an excellent picture. worthy of at least an 8 out of 10. After a very long time marathi cinema has come with some good movie.this movie is one of the best marathi movies ever made. it shows how a old grandfather tries to save his grandsons eye. he tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child's eye. doctor and a relative of his tries to help him in his attempt.the acting by the grandfather, the boy and the doctor are simply superb. they have shown true picture of a typical marathi life. every bit of action has some meaning in it. i would recommend to watch this movie, as initially i thought this one would be of documentary type but this was above my expectations.this film is really going to touch your hearts.i would expect more marathi movies to come up with performances like this. If any style of film could be called my \"guilty pleasure\", it'd be this generic fantasy type. guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time. \"stardust\" is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman (or gaiman adaptation, as it were). it isn't the visual dream-scape of mirrormask, it isn't the adult pretension of pan's labyrinth, and it isn't the fun-loving classic the princess bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now.the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who, in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall, goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star. to make things difficult, however, tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.from there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, robert deniro as a gay pirate. on that note, deniro's performance is spot-on... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting). deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil, and that's saying something.stardust is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time. i can't say it offers anything new, but it's not really there to. it's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most.--polarisdib. Yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass. he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind.the acting was good (apart from thewlis)stone really has a talent with this role. she's slick, naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first.she really impressed me(like in casino). morrisey was also good. he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. thewlis however was lame. he ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. he really sucked.overall, this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch. just ignore thewlis. This is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling . as a teenage singer in america,aaron is not as pop as before,most americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didn't know how to rap.but attention,everyone,he is a kid,how many people can understand him.being a pop fan is difficult,and being a pop star is more difficult.i think this time aaron(jd) has shows something real to us.and i think people should learn to understand each other. at another hand,i like the music in the film very much.i remember the first song appeared in the film is \"saturday night\" and it also include some aaron's real live show,and the second one is \"one better\",so i think if you enjoy this film,maybe you'll be a pop fan,too. at last,i hope you will have a great time^^ a voice from a chinese boy. The duke is a very silly film--a dog becoming a duke! but it's a very fun movie. it has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have, but (thankfully!) no bodily function jokes, as so many animal movies feel compelled to have! mostly, it's just dogs being dogs and people being. . . well, people. the 'good guys' are likeable and appealing. the 'bad guys' are ridiculous, and of course, the pun of many jokes. but there is something dignified about this movie, for even though it is silly, it's not out for every cheap laugh like \"home alone\" and others.crocket, simon and copper do an excellent job playing black and tan coonhound \"hubert\" who becomes the duke after his beloved owner, a real duke, dies. for the most part, they just act like dogs, no 'talking,' or human-like emotions and attitudes. however, they do stereotype poodles, and hubert does fall for her, just because she's a poodle. come on! these are dogs--they have a different view of beauty!!!overall, charming, fun and enjoyable. A great idea: 11 stories about 11 september. 11 directors from different countries with different results. ken loach talking about an immigrant (as usual) is just brilliant (as usual). the frenchman does a very good job also, while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise. however, the israel film was a bit boring, and the mexican guy, well, he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant. 8/10. For a movie with a plot like this i would normally smell \"tearjerker\" in the first ten minutes and turn it off, but this was very well made, with emotional subtleties, great acting, and some genuinely funny moments. it was also interesting to see a different culture - a vanishing one at that. my wife and i both dug it!. Sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty. and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of. if not his best, it's my most loved of all bogdanovich movies.this unique masterpiece remind us, as most of the other films from the director, what life is (or should be) about: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. as the song from whom the films takes its title (gershwin's well known composition) the film makes the impossible true, and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without a line of dialogue, constructed upon the looks and views of the characters --with that \"bogdanovich touch\" based on the point-of-view-- is a class on cinema language, something that p.b. learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies). with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of sinatra's \"trilogy\"), this movie, full of self-consciousness and compassion, and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics wrote), deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed. it's not \"long on style, short on substance\": it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful. I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting. initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me. later i found myself lost in the power of the film. how do you repay a gift from god? the ability of characters to rise above their base natures and respond to the touch from god warmed my heart. the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film. i left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. what more can any film do? hollywood, i hope your paying attention. america does like positive, upbeat films. Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies, i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatum.however it was a very thrilling experience and i didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the interval! i don't think i have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film. since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne. i've heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.the stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. well done. I recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites. this is a spoof on the french cottage industry of oss 117 films of the 50's and 60's. the first oss 117 film based on the novel by jean bruce was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first james bond film, staring ivan desny as hubert bonisseur de la bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with luc merenda, frederick stafford, kerwin matthews and john gaven all taking turns as oss 117. jean dujardin is in the title role in this comedic take on the series. as the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like sean connery. jean françois halim wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. it borrows on the silliness of naked gun, get smart and the pink panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and i am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived oss 117 reworked to comedy adventures. michel hazanavicius directs. i would give this a 7.5 and recommend it. Sometimes it takes a film-making master like kubrick to bring that extra little something, that unique, untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece, one for the ages.it's not just that stephen king's story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss. heck, even king himself didn't fare so bad. it's how kubrick perceives king's universe, how he transforms the page into screen time, that renders the shining both a visual feast and a compacted masterclass in directing.kubrick's miss-en-scene is, as usually, terrific. the movie progresses with a brisk, sharp, lively pace, even though it's neither fast nor heavily edited and it clocks at no less than 160 minutes. the camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur. there's a symmetry and geometrical approach in how kubrick perceives space that reminds me very much of how japanese directors worked in the sixties. as if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame.certain images definitely stand out. the first shot of jack's typewriter, accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball, like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself, later on proving to be nothing short of just that. a red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in slow motion. jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. the ultra fast zoom in the kid's face thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his pov. and of course, the bathroom scene.much has been said of jack nicholson's obtrusive overacting. his mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's jack nicholson. the guy looks half-mad anyway. playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever had. coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies (3 women, thieves like us, nashville), she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress. a terrific and very underrated actress. Why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary \"earth\"? how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you? ok, i will not elongate my review exploration on \"earth\" to infinity, but i must stand my ground on why this is a \"must see\". the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path, a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey, and an elephant mama with her small (maybe not so small, they are elephants) offspring migrating in africa. directors alastair forthegill & mark linfield did an \"out of this earth\" job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists. the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton, mike holding, adam ravetch, and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors; not to mention, the slo-mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e. \"earth\" is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals; the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence. so fellow earthlings, it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit \"earth\" today! **** good. Although it isn't half as hilarious as \"chicken run,\" the new wallace and gromit comedy \"the curse of the were-rabbit\" (*** out of ****) yields more laughs than most live action comedies. british director nick park, who created the wallace and gromit characters, and co-director steve box rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion method of animation--known best as claymation--to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side-splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight. amusing as its whimsical storyline is, the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called plasticine. basically, every shot that you see in \"the curse of the were-rabbit\" required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment. hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. aardman studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day. for the record, \"the curse of the were-rabbit\" took five years to make. the lumpy looking characters, with thumb-prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and over-biting mouths. interestingly, gromit emerges as the funniest character, a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters.wallace and gromit are respectively master and pooch. as the human half of the duo, wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things. one of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes, hatches, and spring-operated contraptions that dress and feed them. meanwhile, gromit is the animal half. the running joke is that gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master. as good as his ideas and inventions are, wallace could not succeed without the loyal gromit giving him a hand. our heroes run a pest protection business called 'anti-pesto.' essentially, they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a bun-van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container. no, wallace and gromit don't kill the critters. instead, they keep them as pets, and wallace experiments with an inventionmind-o-matic--designed to convert hares into carrot-haters. this \"frankenstein\" meets \"the fly\" approach plunges poor wallace into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit. not long thereafter, a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village's 517th annual vegetable contest approaches.initially, wallace and gromit appeared in park's oscar-nominated, film school project \"a grand day out\" (1989). since then aardman has released ten other animated shorts, among them \"wallace and gromit: a close shave\" (1993) and the oscar-winning wallace and gromit: the wrong trousers\" (1995). \"curse of the were-rabbit\" differs not only because it represents the duo's big-screen debut, but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes. the first two-thirds of \"were-rabbit\" contain better gags than the last third, but park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won't get but attentive grown-ups will appreciate. \"wallace and gromit: the curse of the were-rabbit\" is hare-raising fun. For those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects, watch this movie! this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen. you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff. This is an excellent movie. the cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent. the movie is basically about a well-accomplished doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home. once the bodies are at his home, he removes stuff (i hate to use such a general term, but i forget what it was he removed) and puts it into his wife to retain her youth. then a reporter, patricia hunter, investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying. she takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place. definitely watch this oldie, but goodie if you can. I have to say that i know the documentaries of mister örnek and so i knew that i will get a very well made piece of movie documentary. i was not disappointed. as a history nerd - i did saw hundreds of documentary and liked the different approach of this work.the director and his 17 consultants (historians, veteran families) tried to access the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of solders from both sides. so, the history is followed by british, australian and turkish soldiers.narrated is this docu by jeremy irons and sam neill - both boost the intensity and emotionality of this documentary by their great voices.i saw this film in a cinema in italy in dolby surround. i did buy the dvd last year and will wait again 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries.summary: well made. intense. history with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators. I'm 60 years old, a guitarist, (lead/rhythm), and over the last forty years, i've been in four bands, it's all there, the fights, the foul-ups, the rotten food, the worse accommodation, always travelling, little or no money, and every one was drunk or high. but, the clubs, the fans, and the music, made it all worth it! just like strange fruit! i'm too damn old for it now, and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking, but for the length of that video, it all came back, and it was all there! the birds, the brawls, and the booze! and i was young again! it's just like billy connolly's voice over, god likes that 70's stuff! rock on forever!. A kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the slowenian late summer province. at the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth, and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases, you see that the trousers-part is missing on a flag of mourning (appearently his father has died). in the train he meets a young lady, and almost without words, but many small gestures, a wonderful love story begins. it's a somehow surreal, very poetic, and a little bizarre movie, with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents. beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details. Wow! fantastic film in my opinion, i wasn't expecting it to be this good! i was captivated from start to finish- it's a very well made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world, chronicling his life as he writes \"origin of the species\"; fighting both personal demons as well as the ignorant society of the time in order to do so. he struggles hard with his mind, body and soul as personal matters get to breaking point and even his family seems to slip away...whilst the rest of the world stand against him as he knows that his findings literally shake the very foundations of their lives, culture and meaning of existence. it's a subtle movie (not over-exaggerated in any way in that typical hollywood way, this is a bbc produced british film) yet thankfully very powerful in meaning and this is thanks to the amazing well directed scenes as well as the superb acting by bettany. connelly acts as more of a light supporting role but i did enjoy her in this and she's as good as to be expected as always, her chemistry alongside her husband was definitely strong and endearing, you could feel the connection, and their real-life husband/wife bond definitely shines through their performances. but the star of the show is definitely bettany and he does a brilliant job, a very touching performance- i both understood and sympathised with him as he battled his own degrading health and impending \"insanity\" to try to understand what he has uncovered and come to terms with what it all really is and means as he found his thinking contradict his feelings, and found himself losing it all including his wife who of course was a firm believer in religion and a strict christian whilst he was in the realm of science, two worlds which could not see eye to eye, so their relationship was at stake too.anyway- a really very good, well acted emotional drama and dare i say i did shed a tear during the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking as well as beautifully poignant and moving. the film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic as well, in fact i can't wait to watch it again as there was a lot to take in first time round which i missed. easily one of the best films i've seen this year. Overall the film is ok. i think it's better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of its story, its sentimental value.there are a few scenes that makes me touched. yes i agree that the boy (mukhsin) did his acting very good. brilliant. i can say that his acting is almost natural.however, the song 'ne me quitte pas' by nina simone really \"'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' \".i love the song. both the song. \"ne me quitte pas\" and \"hujan\". i just downloaded the song. beautiful.and salute to yasmin. the movie's ending credit makes me touched again. we can see how yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way.i think the movie deserves that grand prix of international jury at berlin film festival.i give 8.5 out of 1o stars. What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and i stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in north texas. kathy bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing. it is obvious that we as a general public are being force-fed that which has been deemed \"great and wonderful\" by the powerful and influential while true gems such as \"unconditional love\" manage to shine thru all those pretenders to really enjoyable cinema. rent or buy this movie.....you won't regret it!. I started watching the apprentice about 4 years ago(maybe 5) and i really really liked it. the first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format, which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core, is still very entertaining. donald trump is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well. the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well. but the best part of the show is new york city. mark burnett may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes nyc look like a character unto itself. the jazz tunes coupled with some great camera-work make new york look spectacular.the apprentice will easily alway make my top 3 reality shows of all time(the amazing race is no. 1,however).but just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation. if you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast(the same case as with tar).star world, the broadcasters in this country, did a bang up job in presenting the show. the first three seasons were shown in a row, then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh.in conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. however if you keep watching the show continuously, thereafter its charm will wear off and fast. I'll say this to begin with:...why, oh why, can't wb do what these short film directors do? sandy is obviously an amazing director, and deserves some credit from wb and dc. but i guess they're kinda put on edge when a man with a $12,000 budget can make a super-hero fan drool. the world's finest is one of the best short films i've ever seen, trailer or not.i think choosing a bodybuilder(mike o'hearn) to play superman was a genius choice. let's face it people, superman is no super-model. he may be handsome, but a gq stud he is not. and i don't know what that guy a few comments above me was on, but superman is actually pretty beefy(have you ever actually read a superman comic?). i guess that fact alone just floors me...it seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual muscle-mass to play a super-hero, rather than a pretty-face. same thing for batman, bartram is in incredible shape, and an excellent batman...i don't know guys...if given a bigger budget, and his own movie...i think bale and bartram would be neck and neck. bottom line, this is one of only a scant few of super-hero movies with actors that actually look the part.the acting is pretty nice as well. i don't know what every one is talking about, o'hearn isn't that bad. he's damn convincing as superman, and bartram...well, he is batman. i mean, come on people, this movie had a $12,000 dollar budget, what were you expecting?. everyone else is great too, except two-face seems a tad crazier than usual...but hey, we only have tommy-lee jones as a reference. oh, lois is pretty hot too.the sfx are flippin' sweet too. i mean, seeing superman lift the car up...man!, how cool is that. versus the \"tank\" scene in grayson, i may have to put this one above that, since mike actually looks like he's flying, and with ease. the flying sequences left something to be desired, but once again, with a bigger budget...oh, and he even used a batmobile!(it was probably a model, but it looked damned convincing).all in all, this trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget. and wb refuses to admit that collora is a credible director, and needs to be apart of some kind a project...but no, they'll(like most of the marvel projects) just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about, and keep churning out these gamble movies. thank god superman returns was a hit, or that seriously would've been the end of it. world's finest is excellent, and in my book, counts as a superhero movie. The freedom of having your own sea going power boat, the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged,an's man of an adventurer and lovely(and so well endowed!) assistants in fine bikinis were all definite selling points for \"sea hunt\"(1958-61).just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going \"gun for hire\"* series. let's look closely now. there must be a some clues around.if we were to look back just a little, we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater! (1955). it starred jane russell, gilbert roland, richard egan and lori nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working on salvage in the carribbean, including a pre-fidel cuba. the film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits. fine, shapely women folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits (woo, woo, woo, woo!) are always a plus for the guys; and the presence of rugged, athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake \"poses\" is equally pleasing to the gals.and there is one element that is a true legacy of this old rko feature. it is on the soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes. it is the recording of \"it's cherry pink and apple blossom white\", written by louiguy and jacques larue and performed by damaso perez prado and his orchestra.anyone who hears this insturmental or song (with lyrics)will not soon forget it. its carribbean beat is so very lively and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory. the 45 rpm record of this song made it to the top 10 most popular songs of the week for many saturday evenings on nbc tv's \"your hit parade\". we can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got. (maybe some one can fill us in on that one item, please!) so, we got back to \"sea hunt\" and its own odyssey in getting on \"the tube\". the public had taken to underwater! all right, but would they go for a tv series.ziv tv productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that, for the most part, didn't get signed on by the networks for the multi-station hook-up treatment. but they had been having some great successes with television syndication.** by that we mean, offering a series for stations for showings on a one to a tv station per each market area. (much like the various newspaper syndicates \"sell\" comic strips to various papers around the country, and world, even.so, we got 'mike nelson', himself, in the physical presence of lloyd bridges. mr. bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of boston blackie movies (with chester morris)to they stooge to conga (3 stooges 1943), sahara (also 1943), home of the brave (1949) and the whistle at eaton falls(1951).lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization, along with a fine, convincingly athletic physique, having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities. he took very well as the diver's diver, whether it's performing duties on board ship, or fathoms beneath the sea.and lloyd did take to the role quickly, but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there, he was not familiar with s.c.u.b.a.*** prior to landing this mike nelson gig. but the athletic mr. bridges proved to be a quick learner, as so many of the close-up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it, that it was lloyd with the mask, the bubbler(air tank) and the flipper fins.stories almost always involved the helping-out some client for pay, much like a private detective would. so what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit, all the better.like so many of the other ziv/united artists tv productions,\"sea hunt\" possessed a fine, haunting opening theme and closing, along with some original incidental music and queues.at one time, i believe that \"sea hunt\" was the top syndicated tv series, a success that ziv series had known before with the likes of \"science fiction theatre\"and \"highway patrol\". as far as the showing venue for this underwater saga, here in chicago it was shown late night (after 10:30 p.m.) on wnbq tv, channel 5 (our nbc affiliate, now known as wmaq tv).and i can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was. and there were even on scene commercials done by the star! how well we can remember and visualize lloyd as mike nelson, riding on his power boat. and as we were being invited to return the next week and watch \".....another adventure of \"sea hunt\", sponsored by the g. heileman brewing company of lacrosse, wisconsin' the makers of old style lager beer!\", all while mike was toasting us, raising an old style bottle. (shame on you, mike! drinking beer on your moving boat! we're tellin' the coast guard!) then, the boat would leave the dock, accompanied by the sea hunt theme and rolling the credits.note: * more figuratively than literal, mike was for hire and things ran very much like a deterctive story.note: ** ziv's syndicated successes included \"science fiction theatre\", \"west point\"(and its clone \"men of annapolis\"), \"sea hunt\" and \"highway patrol\".note*** and of course, scuba is a acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus. A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as lady macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car. a success winning her accolades, betty(christina marsillach)finds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways.first her stage manager boyfriend, stefano(william mcnamara)is viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch, rope-tied to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion, keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch-taped under her eyes, with pricking a result if she blinks. allowing her to escape, betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position, when a specific gold chain is found on her lady macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room, by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors(..to cap off this nasty scene, the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it; while not specifically elaborating this act, dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face). having nowhere to turn, inspector alan santini(urbano barberini, playing him cold and bland at dario's request)promises to catch the psycho as betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort, the theater director marco(ian charleson, of ghandi & chariots of fire who would later die of aids;a sad footnote, dario revealed in an interview that charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was hiv positive)attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics, and pal mira(daria nicolodi, dario's former squeeze), her agent and confident. but, the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will, of course, occur in the theater as marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal.i think this is dario at his most savage & nihilistic. although he has certainly made later gruesome films(..such as his masters of horror entries and sleepless would suggest), this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. his method of forcing betty to watch was admittedly a gag by dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies. i found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blink(..brilliantly, dario shoots the pricking from point-of-view achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open). i like how dario will show the widened eyes of betty, horrified at what she's being forced into watching, as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink. the photographic work of ronnie taylor is impeccable, such as the crow's point-of-view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer. or, when the camera \"travels\" through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat. or, the dream sequence where we are taken into betty's memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer, donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present. the highlight, in my opinion, is the peephole bullet-fire sequence, masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of her head, going through a telephone betty planned to use to call for help. we even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer(..to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it's beak). only aspect i didn't care for, often pointed out by naysayers of the film, is the \"final\" ending which i personally felt was a bit unnecessary, but i guess dario wanted to point out that betty was indeed not like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which, in a twist, relate to why the killer torments our heroine. the rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me, because i felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide. (some spoilers) early 1930's educational movie about the horrors of contracting a social disease and the consequences that come along with it: blindness madness loss of ones abilities to function as well as infecting other people with it, even one's unborn children, and finally death. \"damaged lives\" is far ahead of it's times in educating it's viewers about the dangers venereal deasise. viewed now over 70 years after it's release back in 1933 is as good, if not better, then the many films about that subject made back in the 1940's 1950's and even 1960's.donald bradley, lyman williams, is a top executive of a major shipping company who's been going study with his girlfriend joan, diane sinclair, for some time. both are finally planing to get married and raise a family. out at a party one evening donald meets elsie cooper, charlotte merriam, and together they have one drink too many and before you know it end up spending the night together in elsie's home. thinking nothing of his one night stand with elsie donald later marries his long time love joan and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. at the office donald get a panicked call from elsie telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. rushing over donald finds out, to his horror, that elsie has a sexual infection that she got from her boyfriend nat, harry myers, and that she may have given it to donald, and he in turn may have infected his wife joan. telling elsie that she's wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention elsie shoots herself as donald is just about to leave. getting over elsie's tragic death donald gets another surprise later when his doctor dr. bill hill, jason robards sr, comes over to his office telling him to immediately come with him to the hospital to talk to infectious disease specialist dr. vincent leonard, murray kinnell, about his wife joan who's just been admitted there. the terrible truth about donald and his wife joan hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did joan earlier. both have been infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable,back in the 1930's, infection called venereal disease. told by dr. leonard that it would take some two years of treatment for both donald and joan to be completely cured it leaves joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. later in the film joan, feeling that she has nothing to live for, closes all the windows in her and donald's apartment and turns on the gas stove, full blast, in order to kill herself and donald who was asleep at the time. honest film about the ravages of venereal disease and the damage that it does to those who are infected by it, both psychically as well as mentally, and how it could be cured if given immediate medical care instead of hiding it from one's doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it's too late. Freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, just like when walking, from a shadowy path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from a tree to another, how many different sounds ? just like when traveling, people meet and tell their stories and then part forever, who knows ? and just like when walking through these places full of the lost expectations from another time, the human 'thickness' of the world takes the breath away.i saw this movie with friends of mine, not all of them liked it, maybe were they too used to scenario-based and ready-made stories, i don't know. so this movie is for the silly ones who love looking at the sun sparkling on the sea, walking without any hurry in the hills or through the little villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the stories of those underneath, six feet under, in the warm wind of summer. The obvious parallels between walt disney's charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and c.s. lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent. there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney films.like the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country. and those kids have to deal with a world of magic. but unlike c.s. lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now. no retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kids.no heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson. ms. lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldn't top. and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this film.two performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks. tessie o'shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers. and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world.the team of robert b. sherman and richard m. sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here. the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar, but lost to the theme from shaft. personally though i do like david tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of london streets, portabello road.bedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics. If the movies are to be believed, chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their western counterparts. the storylines of the three 'chinese ghost' films are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that it's not a huge problem. as always, humour is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by a great deal of mugging. for those who haven't encountered the 'chinese ghoststory' trilogy yet, this film offers an interesting departure from the western horror/ghost genre; for those who have, another enjoyable romp in the chinese ghost world. I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. i must say, i was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. i was completely mistaken. this movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it i simply loved. bruce campbell was as amazing as ever. the biggest surprise was none other than ted raimi, you know, sam's little brother. he played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine. but i really cannot ignore the magic that is bruce campbell. though i did think that ted raimi stole the show, bruce did what he does best on the big screen. somewhere between the sketchy nasty american business man and the tragic victim, he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences. the movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. the crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took.this movie may not be oscar material, but my goodness, it was amazing. i would highly recommend this to any bruce campbell fan. also, anybody that likes campy sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch this. can't wait till this makes it out to dvd.take it as you want to....- the fed. Not a box office success; no-one really knows why. it may have failed simply because of its title. it looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - \"die hard\", \"lethal weapon\", \"hard weapon\", \"die lethal\", etc. - talking about \"the long kiss goodnight\" will get you nowhere. but for once renny harlin has made a good action movie. a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, samantha, earns our affection and interest early on. as she becomes charly again, we're torn: we certainly want charly to thwart the bad guys, and all that; but we don't want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so - even though we like charly, too. geena davis bestows all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character. samuel l. jackson plays second fiddle for a change. it turns out he's good at it. that was a compliment.intelligent, far superior to anything in the \"die hard\" series - if i were more cynical i'd add, \"it's not surprising that it didn't do well\", but i don't really feel that way; it is surprising that it didn't do well. I saw this on tv so long ago that i can't remember when it was, but it still stands out as one of the scariest, most unnerving films i've ever seen. there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so that you feel (like the solicitor hero), unsure whether its just imagination or not. it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching. \"production values\" be hanged, good films are about a director's ability to create atmosphere using film, actors, locations/sets, music, attention to detail, and ...imagination. a real gem. This is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife, daughter, and i found it irresistible. the plot is just crazy but \"rings true\" to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities. i particularly enjoyed kevin kline's and sally field's performances. i don't anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded. field's character's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation -- and her almost bipolar swings in mood -- played nicely against the background of field's famous (infamous?) \"you like me!\" oscar exclamation. people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. i think this is the only movie where i didn't find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization; i thought she was \"spot on\" in every note she struck. robert downey jr., teri hatcher, cathy moriarty, and elizabeth shue were also first-rate as well. just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh!. The title sequence shows the credits written on a rain-soaked sidewalk as people trod on it; music is provided by someone whistling alfred newman's \"street scene.\" then we meet det. sgt. mark dixon (dana andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man wasn't: a guy on the right side of the law. but he's pretty vicious for a good guy. after several complaints over his roughing people up, his boss, insp. nicholas foley (robert f. simon), demotes him. foley tells him he's a good man, but needs to get his head on straight and be more like det. lt. thomas (karl malden), who has just gotten a promotion.meanwhile, tommy scalise (gary merrill, in a splendidly slimy performance) has an illegal dice game going and is looking to make a sucker out of the rich ted morrison (harry von zell), who was brought in by ken paine (craig stevens) and his beautiful wife morgan (gene tierney). she figures out too late her husband is using her as a decoy, and paine strikes her when she refuses to play along. the chivalrous morrison intervenes but paine knocks him out cold. that seems to be the worst of it, but later it turns out the guy is dead; and paine looks guilty.but this won't be paine's story. soon dixon has fallen in love with morganbut not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible deed that he tries to cover up. morgan's father, a tale-spinning taxi driver (tom tully), may take the rap for it. it's up to dixon to try to pin the blame on scalise.otto preminger directs a script credited to ben hecht and three others from the novel \"night cry\" by william l. stuart. this is a solid film noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and murky morality we expect from this genre. it holds up until the brightly lit ending, which looks like something the studio had filmed to appease the censors. of course, the classic noir directed by preminger and starring andrews and tierney is \"laura.\" you'll enjoy this, but you can't miss that. Have no illusions, this is a morality story. granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter, tempted back to the plains one more time by kill-crazed taylor. granger can see the end is near, and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt-on the herds, the indians and the land itself. taylor, on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo, or indians to 'being with a woman.' while granger's role of the tortured hunter is superb, it's taylor who steals the show, as the demented, immoral 'everyman' out for the fast buck and the goodtimes. there's not a lot of bang-bang here, but the story moves along quickly, and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan. the theme of this story is just as poignant today, as in the 1800s-man's relationship to the land and what's on it, and racism. considering when this was made, the censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the 'bawdy house', taylor's relationship with the squaw, and much of the dialogue. although downbeat, this is truly a great western picture. This movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it. in some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a \"columbine\" style attack. while this movie does not answer all the big questions, it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with. through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns, made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for \"zero day\". the actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives, but at no stage did i detect them really acting (something tom cruise should try). the use of the cctv and the 911 operator at the end was genius, but i'm not sure if we needed the very last scene. overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic. The invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi. karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even his wife. his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends. this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. it is hard, however to hear his accent and believe he is french. the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on \"junk science\" but, in a way, even the junk science makes it work well. since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are as \"relevant\" today as they were when the movie was made. and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be. this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again. i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times. the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing. i highly recommend it. I wish i could have met ida lupino. when people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner, well, for me one person would be her. i think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities in the film industry. her life story would make a great tele movie (hey, mr bogdanovich........). ida lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. i can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly aip film is the late 70s. she was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. ugh. i should have contacted her then as she died not long after.. more from the part than the worm too. from high sierra, roadhouse and the extraordinary rko thriller on dangerous ground, ida lupino was often the producer and the lead actress. later, with her husband howard duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today. one of them is jennifer which i think is the last film with a monogram pictures copyright. monogram changed the company name formally to allied artists in 1953 and jennifer has both company names on the opening credits. this is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both the innocents and the haunting made 8 years later. really chilling and very creepy, this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film ida lupino made and was responsible for. try and find it...you will always remember it and as i feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress/producer. This is one of the most touching films i had ever watched. no movie has effected me the way this one did. this is a great film and you have to see for yourself. i'm normally impregnable with these sob story movies but this one did it for me. i was in tears at the end. you'll yearn for the friendship that is portrayed in this movie. if i can give this movie a billion stars i could. Dark harbor is a moody little excursion into murky emotional waters that run extremely deep. it's basically a 3-character piece, featuring a finely-layered performance by the always-great rickman, with polly walker and norman reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. a perfect late-night cable film, with a surprise ending to boot. Well i don't know much about anything, but i sure liked this film. in short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. in other words, it was everything it set out to be.the story is set around a girl's first love, (as the title suggests) and i certainly should warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here. i mean, it is a children's cartoon. it's really just a simple story, but it's told well, and it holds your attention well.in the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good. James franco is totally cool in this movie. not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. at the tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole james dean thing but i don't think this true. blind spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. in this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. it's a unique performance. bittersweet and really moving. the lines from his journal cut you like a knife. you sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. the tone is everything. he carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of gallows humor. i like the other two actors a great deal too. the blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy stoicism. some of the thugs seemed a little sketchy but this is a mini-point really. the film is totally solid and franco is way cool all around. Thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless. i think jason is being judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father. maybe he's not as great as some of those actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. i watched the movie some years ago, and i actually loved it. i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood. but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on. it was really good!during the movie, i actually forgot he was the son of. sean.. who?and if you're a shakespeare lover, i can recommend this movie. i'm sure you'll enjoy it!. This is a delightful gem of a movie, unfortunately pigeon-holed as \"just for kids.\" the plot revolves around a young man, roy eberhardt, newly arrived in southwest florida from the montana mountains. trying to fit in with the other kids at his middle school, roy discovers a brother-sister team trying to protect endangered burrowing owls at an illegal construction site. look for carl hiassen, the author of the book upon which this movie is based, as the male secretary to the evil boss at corporate headquarters. writer/director wil shriner is also the clerk at the public records office where the intrepid teen-detectives discover that the incriminating environmental impact report is missing. luke wilson nearly steals all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have most of the best lines. wilson is the bumbling police officer, in his three-wheeled electric police cart complete with blue light and funky siren. as officer dave, he tries so hard to do well, but usually ends up falling in the muck, literally! several times! jimmy buffet is pretty low key as the tacitly supportive science teacher. but, young actors logan lerman (roy), brie larson (beatrice the bear), and cody linley (mullet fingers) are superb as the teens who finally put officer dave on the right track, following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss. i hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as i did. just plain fun! one small complaint, though. i hope all non-floridians realize that not everyone from florida is as surly to newcomers as depicted in this film. we're really a friendly bunch! just ask carl hiassen and jimmy buffet!!. I have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of spirit. the best thing about the movie i think is that the animals isn't able to talk, this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10/10 from the kids and me. Stargate is the best show ever. all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles. i love the connection between the characters. if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it. although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different. i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks. unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time (which is highly depressing). however this program is very very good and is a must see, but be warned it is highly addictive. so in summery i love stargate (and amanda tapping). Man, is it great just to see young and the restless star melody thomas scott as something other than flighty nikki newman! a doctor with a brain no less! and super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous lorenzo lamas instead of victor newman!mel plays a college professor of micro-biology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break, only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus. handy for her there is the hunky character played by lorenzo, who has a daughter just her son's age.mel shines, as does lorenzo with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple. interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism talk. worthwhile seeing, especially for y&r fans. This version of the gulliver stories is definitely bizarre. the production adds a frame story (that's what it's becoming famous for) of gulliver returning to his wife and son. in one vieweing, incredibly overlong and sometimes fails to hold attention throughout, but the odd images and diverse cast will keep you looking. mary steenburgen does the best job of the cast. danson seems a bit out of place with his american accent. the whole asylum thing is awfully disturbing often, but is nonetheless interesting and holds the journeys of gulliver together well. danson's character really does seem insane, however... he should have worked on being a little more believeable to everyone, in my opinion. also confusing is going from present to past. anyone else think the yahoos are the ugliest things ever to grace a television screen (or in line for it)? confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by some good acting, overall wonderful visual effects, and a few enjoyable parts. nbc's first of many event films from robert halmi, sr. see it for yourself to decide how it goes for you, however i give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars). John carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of sci-fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. a remake of the howard hawks produced 1951 original, carpenter keeps the cold-war themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the antarctic setting. carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. but here and much like the work of david cronenberg, carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. however, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10. Just saw the movie, and the scary thing was, the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors. the movie had its moments, but also lagged and was rather sick. it was all meant to be a farce, but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie, you think to yourself \"people like this are all around us\" all attempts at getting the audience's sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another. on the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. i think i would wait for video- but it was a good laugh. warning- jerry takes his shirt off during the movie!! (not a pretty sight!). I almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked. the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station.they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy. it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be. the make-up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one. it was a simple story with believable acting.it's not the scariest or goriest movie, but i wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it. on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out. Hell to pay is a bit bloody for my taste, even though it is no worse than many films. nevertheless, i did enjoy the parade of seasoned stars and the western scenery & all; but, the story-line was very weak and i couldn't really see the point of it all. however, the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the lackluster film.where did the guys -nate & noah cryns- who wrote this music come from? they are awesome!! from the moment the music begins, it is by far, better than anything i've heard in years. i think it may be the best i've ever heard! even though i wasn't thrilled with the action taking place on the film, the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene. i was transported in time to the old west during the opening credits and really felt like i was re-living those old days through the music.this movie is definitely worth a purchase and a viewing for the beautiful music and a trip down memory lane to see the old western stars once again. This film is so different to anything you would have seen before. it's an honest and chilling account of an entire family's battle with a terminal illness. 'the closer she gets' is shot in a very unique style. craig oulette films in a very different way.... using different angles and viewpoints, in what i find is a very eye catching manner (perhaps due to his experience with photographic works). his style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing, but what loved ones close to her also have to deal with. a very sad, but extremely interesting and unique film. one i would definitely suggest watching. This definitely the most tension filled x-files episode of the first season. this episode is what i think of when i hear \"x-files\". the plot is simple but exiting. our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an alskan outpost in which it's research team appears to have killed each other. it turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice, had infected the research team. the parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity. soon none can tell who they can trust, or who's infected or not.this episode was a direct tribute to john carpenters great horror film \"the thing\". the thing is set in antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which it's occupant have been killed or killed themselves. an alien that had been buried in the ice for a 10000 years had been thawed out. it has the abilities to imitate any life form. therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foes.believe me the thing is one of the most exiting, and tension filled horror movies you'll ever see. if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it. or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see ice.ice is the best direct tribute/homage to john carpenter's the thing i have ever seen, and it lives up to it's inspiration as one of the best x-files episodes. i give it a 10/10. This was the second of the series of 6 \"classic tarzan\" movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o'sullivan as jane.as usual, this was a wonderful film in this series; and perhaps stands out as an \"in between\" film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s. as such, it displayed good pace, though not as good as subsequent films. likewise, the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series. the stock i saw was of uneven quality, containing some grainy scenery and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes. the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here. on the other hand, there is one scene, very early on, in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up, showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle, was really almost modern in its style, and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie.regarding plot, one interesting feature here was jane's near-fickleness and inconstancy, when she was being subject to martin's flirtations. the kiss  and jane's stunned, and partly guilty, reaction  foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films. compare, for example, in tarzan finds a son! jane's duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family. later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong. here, nothing quite so explicit, but we have jane \"returning\" to the jane parker of yesteryear, and in an almost repentant series of actions, stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzan.there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing.for one thing, the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here, as later, a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death. this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience.i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today's standards.there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants' graveyard; tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo, and then nursed to health by the apes; cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log. the final battle scenes of savages & lions on the ground and savages & apes in the trees. jane, showing us that she is truly of tarzan's world now, quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away.the final series of scenes is splendid: suddenly tarzan is on the scene, flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions, and summoning the elephants to the rescue! that final cry of tarzan in triumph, holding a happy jane in his arms, with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them, is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and jane.all in all, this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie. i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone. This is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - it was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and the '80s saw plenty of them)! i saw this movie when it first came out, and instantly liked it. being a big fan of kiss, it was great to see gene in the movie. and anything with ozzy as a metal-hating preacher can't be all bad! also, fastway was already a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack.the original vhs (this was pre-dvd) cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a \"demon\" looking on. it was a special order, and the price for the vhs copy at the time (circa 1987) was $90! i really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. the 'ozzy-gene' cover was only created for the $5 re-release. the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they had better put 'em on the cover! same thing with the original \"little shop of horrors\" - jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star.i have a \"trick or treat\" web site, and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person! fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr'.all-in-all, it was just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. definitely not to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed!. My friend and i picked \"paperhouse\" out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the horror section-- neither of us had heard of it, but the blurb on the box was really promising. and the movie didn't disappoint, though i still probably wouldn't call it a horror movie exclusively.11-year old anna madden draws a house, and visits it in her dreams. she is definitely asleep when she's seeing the house, but it's so real in a sense that it's almost like a completely separate reality. which, in view of later events, doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth. anyhow, she finds she can add to the house, its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture. while this is going on, anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever, and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing. on top of that, she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father; he has a job that takes him away for long stretches, though one gets the impression there's actually more to the story than that.ok, so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough-- but frankly there's something really menacing about it. the dreamworld is eerily surreal -- the house, for instance, is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field. the folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world/ongoing dream...one of the things anna adds to the house is a boy, mark, who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about (i'm not giving that away, you know from the moment he appears that it's the same kid). in reality, mark can't walk due to an illness; in anna's drawing-world, he can't walk because she didn't draw him any legs. she blames herself for his real-life illness, and tries to rectify the situation, but... everything starts getting really weird. she even brings her absent father into the drawing, with disastrous results. the bits with the father are really terrifying.i don't want to give anything away, so i'll stop there... there seems to be a lot going on in this film. i'm sure you'll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it-- is it a simple a story as it seems, or are there actually layers of meaning? i don't know, but either way it's quite fascinating. there was a \"nightmare on elm street\"-ish quality about it, in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect. i love things like that.my only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times, but didn't. i'm satisfied with the ending it had (some of you sensitive types might want to have kleenex handy!), though it really could have a variety of conclusions. anyway, it doesn't exactly feel drawn out once it's actually over, but while you're watching and it keeps fading back in, it's a little nerve wracking.still, \"paperhouse\" is a really good film. it's well done, and acting-- especially charlotte burke as anna-- is top notch. burke, who has never before or since appeared in a film, is a real gem. i don't know why she never went onto do anything else, but either way she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch.\"paperhouse\" isn't exactly a horror movie, it's sort of a fantasy/suspense/something else type of movie, with some definite horroresque moments-- but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something.give it a chance, you won't regret it! and maybe you should read the book, too... Zp is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. the explosion that daria imagines, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally mark's death anticipates the end that a sees for the movement itself. the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life. during the 60 ' and 70' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. one of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from. i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which a depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct. repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students. this society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents mark 's inner wish for it but , his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said, a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game. in my point of view a film to remember. Jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006, beating the also hilarious clerks ii. it is one of the best sequels in recent memory, beating jackass the movie in every way. now, this film may be the funniest, but it is also the most offensive, appalling, and utterly disgusting. you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film. i'm completely serious when i say don't eat anything before watching or during this film, because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you. keep the drinking to a minimum as well. you've been warned, because, just like the tagline says, it will make you beg for mercy.jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass, johnny knoxville, bam margera, ryan dunn, steve-o, chris 'party boy' pontius, preston lacy, ehren mcghehey, dave england, brandon dicamillo, and jason 'wee man' acuna (chris 'raab himself' raab is absent) as they perform the most outrageous, life-threatening, and revolting stunts imaginable. i'm not going to tell what the stunts are, but i will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening, and that one cast member (once again, not telling) will flirt with death several times in the film.what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them. to put it simple, if they loved doing it and had a blast, you will too (this goes for 99% of the stunts). all the stunts are very original, and 90% of them are never-before-seen. you will witness a few recycled ones, but they're amped up. you wouldn't think directing really factors into a movie like this, but it does; jeff tremaine's direction makes the movie so much funnier, because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing, which is simply brilliant on his part. he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming (actually, you'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming), but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could. i give mr. tremaine two thumbs up for that. another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos, and this time they include bmx legend mat hoffman, skateboard god tony hawk, director/actor jay chandrasekhar (super troopers & beerfest), actor luke wilson, miami dolphins star jason taylor, and director/actor mike judge (office space). the scenes with hoffman, taylor, and chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, as it's even funnier to see these men as a part of the film.jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and just plain wrong movies of all time, if not the most. despite this, it is so original and so hilarious that you won't care about that. you'll be gasping for air, laughing so hard you'll be crying, and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film. due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this film. you've been warned. i hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as i did.10/10 --spy. Just kidding about the weight loss thing; well, you might lose weight you never know. anyway, what can i say, i love this film. it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies. jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them. the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery, and horror they perceive. jake's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with. watch it with friends; watch it with loved ones; build a fort - wine optional. There i was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this b-movie festival in breda. i was resistant, as i hadn't gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater, but i've got to admit that i don't regret a second of this one (especially with stephen malkmus' contribution). it probably helped that i had no idea what to expect.sea of dust starts out like a typical costume drama. we've got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which somehow involves exploding heads). on the way, he stops to visit his fiancé and gets thrown off the property by her father. traveling on, he finds a girl lying on the road, another plague victim, and takes her along to the doctor's. yawn, i thought. it all seemed pretty predicable.and then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film. tom savini shows up looking like dracula, characters begin traveling to \"the other side\" of reality, and the dialog gets increasingly humorous.and just when i thought it had settled into a groove, the picture changes again, becoming really dark and bizarre. i won't spoil it for first time viewers, but there's an amazing sequence about hollow people, lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society, and some over-the-top gore effects. and did i mention stephen malkmus? this isn't a perfect movie (in case you haven't figured that out from its appearance at a b-movie festival), but it's well worth the time for adventurous viewers. great visuals, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. the acting is a little zany at times, but i think that's the point.funny i had to go to breda to see find an american picture that looked like a british horror movie. you figure that one out... Alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's. never attempts to be an \"event\". just wants to entertain. and it does. i was surprised by kiefer sutherland. in a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. the plot does make allusions to alice in wonderland. a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and kiefer does fall down one. like alice the plot does twist and turn, but with a freshness you don't see in small movies. i loved the direction, sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie. /the first episode i saw of lost made me think, i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster. but it's not like that, it's far more than that,because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost , well it's getting better every time. a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed. that's the real secret.this series rules and i can't wait to know what's really going on there i hope that they don't air the last 2 episodes in the theaters,this series deserves a 9 out of 10. A new way to enjoy goldsworthy's work, rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion. watching goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. although, i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), i do feel it was a bit long. the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy's work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch. Don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started? it sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herrings before some real action takes place. \"tourist trap\" isn't like that! if it's typically gruesome slashing you want...than it's typically gruesome slashing you'll get! plenty of it and constantly from start to finish! this movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in 80's horror cinema when a teenager, on a stroll after engine trouble, is trapped in a deserted house and assaulted by a creepy collection of wax statues. four other lambs to the slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an utterly insane maniac that looks somewhat like a mixture of leatherface (from \"texas chainsaw massacre\") and one of those mad sculptors from old wax-museum movies. \"tourist trap\" is exciting horror entertainment, with some genuine suspense, grisly images, ultimate weirdness, morbid humor and terrific make-up effects. the plot twists aren't always original and the acting is pretty lousy but, seriously, who cares? the fast pacing and the groovy killer-icon caused this \"tourist trap\" to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers. a bit surprising is the total lack of nudity, though. too bad, because all the girls look ravishing and after only 10 minutes, the obligatory line \"who needs a bathing-suit?\" is spoken. Now either you like mr carrey's humour or you don't. me, myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth. bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.if you're not sure, watch the trailer. i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film. if you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie.carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot. god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better. carrey gets into the swing of having all of god's powers by making his girlfriend (jennifer aniston)'s breasts bigger, getting himself promoted, and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands.this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders.on the more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes. his most accomplished 'straight' role, the man on the moon, is less well known that his comedy romps - or the truman show (on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey). \"nuovomondo (2006)\" (shown in the u.s. as \"the golden door\") was written and directed by emanuele crialese. this film is different--and, i think, better--than most movies about impoverished people who leave europe and come to the united states.the film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of sicily. we always hear that sicily is a rocky island, but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half-hour of \"the golden door.\" the middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the u.s. most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third-class section becoming seasick, and then show us the statue of liberty. not this movie--we get a sense for life below decks, and it isn't charming. (we never actually see the statue of liberty, either.) finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of ellis island, and then the immigrants are walking through new york's lower east side. not here--the ellis island experience occupies about one-third of the footage. vincenzo amato is outstanding as salvatore mancuso, who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world. charlotte gainsbourg is equally good as lucy reed, a mysterious englishwoman who also speaks fluent italian.there are some strange touches in the movie, especially the sound track with songs by nina simone. there must be some symbolism there, but i couldn't make sense of it.another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on dvd. still, large screen or small screen, it's worth seeking out. Wow, just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this. while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing (i.e. accident, hospital scenes, second to last end scenes), for a first directorial effort, i give this 10 stars! i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if you're a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box, i highly, highly recommend this movie. i think the director and writer, jay floyd, should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. based on his credits, he may be another quentin tarantino. Surprised to see the rather low score for this movie. just saw this film for the first time in 10 years, and was reminded why i like it.come back with me, children, to a time when michael keaton was a straight-up comedy guy, and you might find some joy in this film. it's a gentle comedy -- the kind ron howard specializes in -- but if that's your thing, you should check this out. keaton's low-key charm is just right for this project.\"gung ho\" is a bit dated, because it takes places in the last stage of the pre-global economy world, when it still mattered what country a business was based in. that said, it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other, to great benefit.you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked, but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs. it's like an i.v. drip. and i mean that in a good way. This could be well have been the definitive film noir of all time, had not the columbia studios cut so much of orson welles's original. what we are left with is a flawed, yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of welles as an actor/director and rita hayworth as a serious dramatic talent.'the lady from shanghai' is film noir at it's most sizzling and confusing. welles, with an uneven accent, portrays michael o'hara, a journeyman irishman, who, after a fateful encounter with the seductive, dangerous elsa bannister (hayworth, in a great performance)finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband's (everett sloane) yacht. elsa, or 'rosalie' as michael likes to call her, plays the innocent, helpless doll very well, ensnaring o'hara in her web. as the lovers conduct a not-so-secret affair at sea, arthur bannister's partner in his law firm, george grisby (glenn anders)comes aboard. he is a weird, untrustworthy figure who offers michael a unique proposal: he will get $5000 to assist grisby in the faking of grisby's death, so it looks murder. the plan is for michael to get off a technicality, and run off into the sun with elsa. but things do not go to plan.hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal. at times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child-like, at others brutal, world-weary and hard. always she is brilliantly beautiful, whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black, brandishing a gun. hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is a far-cry from her famous 'gilda' role. her then-husband orson welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop (angering columbia boss harry cohn). it was a terrific marketing ploy, and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully. she is not the sympathetic femme fatale that 'gilda' is, here- instead she is a predatory, black-hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option.the welles and hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage. they would divorce after the film was made, so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship. they are hateful, not romantic, lovers in this, so it's hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen. certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality, with welles as the 'fall guy' (he even admits it himself in the film!) and rita as the double-crossing babe.welles character is the typical noir 'drifter' with not much sense. as welles voice-over proves to use, o'hara indeed does not use his brain very much 'expect to be thinking of her (elsa)'. welles usually played intelligent, charismatic fellows, so his turn here as the dim-witted michael is unusual and very interesting. indeed, welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well.everett sloane is suitably slimy as hayworth's crippled husband. one wonders why he hires michael. it is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically, so why does he invite a 'threat' on board? one interpretation could be that michael provides the 'service' to his wife that bannister cannot in his crippled state. there is definitely something to that theory, with a lot of implications toward elsa's behaviour before she met her husband (was she some sort of prostitute?)and grisby's knowledge of bannister's most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes.this is a jumbled, convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed. we are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot, as with most noirs. welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches, including the justifiably famous 'hall of mirrors' climax. it's a terrific scene, one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness. this fun house scene is visually stunning, with a dali-like feel to the painted sets (apparently orson painted them himself). subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought-provoking experience.the dialogue is scorching and confusing, delivered superbly by rita's alternately breathy low voice and helpless, high-pitched little-girl voice. hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one, and proves that she is the ultimate femme fatale of 'noir'. it's a pity (only a slight one , as rita was a brilliant dancer) that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for columbia in the 40's instead of darkly-themed noir like this. she was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent.9/10. Interesting characters, lots of tension. as close to black and white without being black and white. i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character, a quiet, near deaf secretary, was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues, rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist, and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away. i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks. in this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with, or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot. too bad, the film could have been great. This is a great film for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. it's enjoyable, and a vaguely feel-good movie.a minor, but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we don't know why justine and chas broke up. okay, most first relationships don't work for one reason or another, but they more or less seemed like a nice couple.in a nutshell, it's worth a watch to escape reality. It has to be admitted that the best work of harold lloyd ended with his last great silent comedy \"speedy\" in 1928. after that he enters sound films (like chaplin and keaton and laurel & hardy and w.c. fields) and does do better than keaton, but not as well as the other three. chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as producer (but he paced his films so there were five years between productions). laurel & hardy were under the protection of hal roach, so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good. fields first worked with mack sennett, than with paramount, and then free-lanced. lloyd tried the route that chaplin took, but with less success.he produced his own films, but unlike chaplin he did not own his own studio. also his first two choices were not good (especially \"feet first\"). but he did begin to choose more wisely and \"movie crazy\", \"the cat's-paw\", and \"the milky way\" were all good choices. these three (and possibly \"the sin of harold diddlebock\") were his best sound ventures. they are all entertaining, but none are up to \"safety last\", \"the freshman\", \"the kid brother\", or \"speedy\". of the top four sound films \"the cat's paw\" is the most controversial. ezekiel cobb's solution to ridding the city that elects him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005. or is it? when a movie is made dictates what it's politics are: \"the cat's paw\" is from 1934. that second year of the roosevelt new deal (itself rather controversial for heavier government involvement) movie audiences saw films like \"gabriel over the white house\" and \"the phantom president\", where our leaders did extra-constitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies (and to force disarmament around the globe). even cecil b. de mille got into this act with \"this day and age\", where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes.to us, the use of violence to force anyone (even a bunch of goons and boodlers like alan dinehart's gang) to confess is repellent. after all, the supreme court has protected us from confession under duress. what we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not occur until the warren court and the burger court made them. for example, although mr. justice sutherland's opinion in the powell (\"scottsboro boys\") case of 1932 guaranteed every criminal defendant had a right to counsel, gideon v. wainwright did not extend this to ordering court paid counsel to defendants until 1962. the miranda case, with it's now well-known anti-self-incrimination warning is from 1963. nothing like this were considered necessary in 1934.if you study other movies of the period up to 1954 (and even to 1960) tricks are used to get confessions - kirk douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in \"i walk alone\" while burt lancaster holds a gun to him. when lancaster leaves, douglas sneers about confessing under duress, only to see the gun is unloaded. suddenly he realizes that (legally - in 1948) he has confessed without duress. hate to say it, to any civil libertarians reading this note, but what cobb/lloyd does to dinehart and his pals in the conclusion of \"the cat's paw\" was not only legal, but would have led to their jail sentences in 1934. we may call it heavy handed, fascistic, or horrid, but it would have worked legally when it was thought up. I saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of 'beyond redemption'. i was searching for new material to watch, since most of the reruns one saturday morning didn't interest me. i've always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael ironside, so i chose this movie. i was pleasantly surprised.personally, i enjoyed the film. rich roesing, who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box, are well justified. i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film. this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page.i like suspense movies, and this one was no exception. the movie kept me guessing until the very end. i was surprised by the ending!the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense. his reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian, yet conflictual, side of police work. the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition.if you like suspense films, but also like films that expound on the character's feeling, personal inflection side, this film is for you.should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system's guide, watch it!however, if you are looking for a rental video, follow rich roesing's advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it. It's now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. i haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years. now that i'm an adult in my 30s i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes again.in concept, the cartoon is partly an homage to the classic looney tunes but also its own original show. there are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons. for example, there is a singer that attacks buster and so he exacts revenge on this singer's concert -exactly like the old bugs bunny cartoon. the ensuing cartoon is similar to looney tunes, just in a different era. if you look at the old looney tunes, they did an awful lot of stuff exactly like tiny toons did. the old looney tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody. there were celebrity impersonations. there were a lot of corny period jokes, slang, and dialog. the comedy was surreal and wacky. you can say this exactly for tiny toons as well. the comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadn't been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades prior to this show. we recognize the cultural references in tiny toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. but the reason we don't think looney tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s. also, looney tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over. so it's easy to perceive tiny toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general.there certainly are differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery, and obviously the duration of the shows. they are two different styles from two different periods, being done under two very different circumstances - looney tunes being made for adults in theaters and tiny toons being made for kids watching tv. even so, they did a good job making an original show with original gags and still paying homage to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old looney tunes.since tiny toons had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. you only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. for example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in thirteensomething when babs and buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. the miscommunication is spectacular. notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by deanna oliver or sherri stoner) is rather good. the female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.this was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. this was way ahead of its time. tiny toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. yes, i loved transformers and thundercats, but tiny toons totally jumped away from all that. it was a breath of fresh air. bakshi's new adventures of mighty mouse may have been a precursor, but tiny toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.as a kid i totally overlooked some jokes. for example, one episode is an homage to the marx brothers that i completely ignored as a teen. now i have a newfound respect for it. there are so many inspired gags that i never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. it's that kind of comedy that makes me think of looney tunes and family guy. i never noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. i've been thinking this for most episodes i watched recently.you'd notice these kinds of things if you actually watched the show. unlike some other reviewers here who i know are unfairly judging it, i've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. i'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. but back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. tress macneille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. she hasn't been the same since. rob paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.this is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. it had plenty. it had a lot of mediocre ones, too. but by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.out of 10 i give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons. It's along the line of comedy of errors, mistaken affection transferring from one to another, blossoms and passes onkinda cat and mouse situations flares of passion, sparks of fire fanned and put outguessing maybe she loves, he loves or they love circle of emotions, evolving, releasinghiding, yet not hidingwanting to let him know, wanting to let her know, let them know good ensemble cast in spite of the seemingly confusing mix of emotions from different parties involved. it's a refreshing charmer, casual, free and easy and rather down to earth -- not hollywood glamorous like \"notting hill\", but lots of human feelings, frailty, vulnerability a-flowing. yes, all revolving around an accidentally (lost &) found love letter. kate capshaw as the owner of the town's bookstore, with a variety of characters portrayed by ellen degeneres, tom selleck, blythe danner, tom everett scott, gloria stuart, alice drummond and geraldine mcewan as the seemingly unaffected mrs. scattergoods. romance is in the air, love lurking everywhere. you get to appreciate the talented kate capshaw. (\"the alarmist\" is another quirky little movie which is fun to watch: capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with david arquette, and arquette with stanley tucci).\"notting hill\" is satisfying in its story revolving around the glittering pairing of julia roberts and hugh grant, and the wonderful support of his circle of (london) friends. \"love letters\" is delightful in its quirky (loblolly) small town-ness, and its story involving kate capshaw's centrifuged ripple effects on her friends and neighbors. both maybe fantasies, somehow, the latter felt more attainable if it should happen to you. and if you appreciate words or poetic lines, it could be the movie for you. College girl joanne murray takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments,which includes selling the unneeded furniture this takes place during a break,so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly-empty premises on campus.\"dorm that dripped blood\" is a low-budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining.the acting is pretty bad,the plot is predictable,but the gore effects are quite good.the film was made by ucla film students stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow for next to nothing.soon a dreamy ambiance kicks in,very similar to the enveloping forests of jeff leiberman's fantastic \"just before dawn\".7 out of 10.it's great to see daphne zuniga of \"the initiation\" fame run over few times by a car. I was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie, which is why i left it unwatched for so long, but i was very pleasantly surprised.far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.it's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching. hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning? who's dying?alexandra staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as monica vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face, her hair, and her tall, slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics.nikolaj coaster-waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad-guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable (and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). i can't think of a single one of hollywood's \"former waiters\" who could have pulled the role off that well.fortunately, blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) that's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes. Excellent view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). the way she gets involved into this special \"business\", the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh, light and funny comedy. i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.i love european films, and with movies like this one, my opinion grows stronger. a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is waking ned devine.saving grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself. you will love it. This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts. donald crowhurst was an english businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the sunday times golden globe race, a single-handed, round-the-world yacht race.i was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer john smithson, who is also the producer of \"touching the void\", one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003. i had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event, and i'm relieved that it didn't let me down. for 92 minutes i was led through a haunting story and came out with much to think about.without any reenactment, this film made great use of the limited audio and video archive footage they found and turned it into a compelling story which allowed the audience to understand crowhurst from a personal level. the story unveiled itself as people who had direct links to the events including his wife and his son, and the eventual winner, also the only one who made it back out of the 9 competitors, robin knox-johnston gave their own accounts of what happened almost 40 years ago.crowhurst's logs(journals) that he kept during the 243 days at sea are so haunting that it made it much easier for me to come to understand what being in total isolation can do to a man. while crowhurst's body was never found, the other competitor nigel tetley whose yacht sank just weeks before claiming the prize for fastest passage committed suicide three years later after unsuccessful attempts at properly completing a circumnavigation.everything could take its toll, especially the sea.the director louise osmond was also at the q&a session after the showing together with producer john smithson. i had no idea that it's a female director and that just came as a very nice surprise. the film is getting a limited release in the uk (a couple of days in certain cinemas). catch it in cinema while you can, unless you have a state of the art sound system that can recreate the sound of the bashing southern ocean.. then i'm sure they'll soon have it on dvds too. This is a trio of tales, \"shakti\", \"devi\", and \"kali\", about an experimental commune (or some such thing) called the taylor-eriksson group, which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown, and left a bit of damage here and there, i'd say. many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself. shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed. seems this woman is able to project some inner demon, or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to \"jump out of his skin\". he's a skinhead, a speed freak, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune, which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire. this is probably the best of the three segments. kali tells the tale of a healer, who attempts to \"heal\" this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did it or if she loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer. all three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness. this has a sort of low-budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout, much to its credit. i watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares (and gore) came it hit pretty hard. i found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot. a good little find, this one, i'd give it 8 out of 10. I loved this program, and for years searched for it on video. i've contacted a great many folks in my attempts to get a copy...to no avail.i do, however, have the second half of the program. i would be willing to share my half, with anyone who can give me a copy of the first half of this show. i'd offer to provide copies of what i have to anyone, but it's just only part of the program...so it's just not an adequate representation of the show.there are a few folks selling this on ebay for some incredible cost (and that's plainly not fair...not to mention blatant copyright violations!).please send any correspondence to: thndrmouse@aol.com. \"crossfire\" is ostensibly a murder mystery but what distinguishes it from other similar movies of the period is the killer's motive, which is anti-semitism. the story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance which fuels bigotry and contains references to a \"hillbilly\" and an irish immigrant who also suffered maltreatment because of their ethnicity.the movie's plot is based on richard brooks' novel called \"the brick foxhole\" which is about a hate crime where the victim was gay. it's ironic that this story about a form of intolerance should be met with intolerance by the censors who stipulated that, for the screen version, the type of bigotry involved should be changed to anti-semitism. another irony is the behaviour of a soldier who seems fiercely proud of having served in a war against the nazis and yet embraces their hatred of jews. the director and producer of this movie also suffered another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the \"house un-american activities committee\". all these points just seem to underline the deeply entrenched and intractable nature of the whole problem of bigotry as depicted in this movie.when police captain finlay (robert young) investigates the murder of joseph samuels (sam levene), he discovers that on the night when he was killed, samuels had been socialising with a group of soldiers and one of these, corporal arthur \"mitch\" mitchell (george cooper) is quickly identified as the prime suspect. further information is also gathered from montgomery (robert ryan) who is another of the soldiers who was present that night and sergeant keeley (robert mitchum) who's a friend of mitchell. keeley, with the help of some other soldiers, then searches for mitchell and when he finds him, hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder including his meeting with a dance hall hostess called ginny tremaine (gloria grahame).keeley helps michell to avoid being arrested and tries to identify the murderer. ginny tremaine is questioned but her information is insufficient to prove mitchell's innocence but finlay's investigations lead him to recognise the motive for the crime and subsequently, he sets up an elaborate trap which leads the real culprit into exposing his own guilt.\"crossfire\" is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story. the \"message\" is conveyed in a way which was, no doubt, appropriate for the period in which it was made but by today's standards seems rather heavy handed. the cinematography by j roy hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps combining to evoke a look which is perfectly compatible with the drama being played out on screen.despite it being a low budget production, \"crossfire\" was a great box office success and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast, two of whom were nominated for academy awards for best supporting actor (robert ryan) and best supporting actress (gloria grahame). the additional nominations for edward dmytryk (best director), producer adrian scott (best picture) and john paxton (best writing, adapted screenplay) are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie justifiably received. The events of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers. in my view it would have been better to leave this out. i think the directors tried too hard, perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop. the comment of one of a policemen - \"this aint f***ing disneyworld\" is apt.nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events. the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other footage from the day matches what they shot. I am a huge john denver fan. i have a large collection of his music on vinyl. i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it. i have the original vinyl album and cd. i have the original cd and later release. the later release is missing several songs though. i see that it has been released this year with all original songs. to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at $75.00. wow - to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much. to me no amount is worth selling this treasure. it is my favorite christmas cd. i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd. i would love to have either version. if anyone has one available please let me know. thanks. It's fun and fast paced, as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable, surprising conclusion. the suspense separates this holiday flick from all others. one wonders how the pieces are going to fit, both during the movie and in the future.the character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. sinkewicz (frank jenks) shows us what manipulation can get...and ultimately what manipulation can cost! uncle felix (s.z. sakall) sizes up each person for us while trying to protect \"lishka\" (barbara stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end.if we could ever achieve a perfect world, imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these.a glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed uncle felix's watch. i've heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store.watch it, and you'll really feel like you've been somewhere!. Horses on mars is a wonderful journey taken by very small creatures. it doesn't have to work hard to hold your attention and the characters are truly memorable. most of the credit must go to eric anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story, but credit is also deserved by anuj majumdar for the narration and the wonderful music score. these choices were obviously not an accident. if you can, see it in 35mm scope for the most impact. it is quite a beautiful film!. The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be. this movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. kidman, being one of my favorites, of course i'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. three out of four stars. 9/5/02. Almost 30 years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender. periodically, i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd. it's september of 2004, and i keep hoping -- deep sigh.one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime-time evening soap; the other, frances lee mccain, was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced, as i recall it, on a short-lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playwrights.i watched it every time it was shown on pbs, maybe 2 or 3 times. that was before the era of vcrs, so i have no record of it, except in my mind's eye.12/31/2006 addition to above: happy new year, ladies! this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper.org. my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer's own personal copy. Like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (it must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first.) like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle-eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work. a freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ... i don't know why it all works, but it does. everything is just so beautiful. the sets are beautiful. june duprez is beautiful. rozsa's score is especially beautiful. as usual, it sounds hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being hungarian in a persian way. One type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak, which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong, finally decides there is no other way. there is a great moment in this film when john parrish (glenn ford) goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter wade matlock. it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud. in my opinion the violent men is a great western, i would rank it among the best. it makes great use of the wide screen, a spectacular scenery of the mountains. the women have a crucial part. caroline (may winn) is engaged to parrish, but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east. she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price. martha (barbara stanwick), is tired of helping her crippled husband lee (edward g. robinson) but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power. meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother (brian keith). her daughter judith (diane foster) is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father. parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch. like he had warned lee, \"don't make me fight because you won't like my way of fighting\". This is one of the best films ever made. it is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of american history. the setting is 1906 wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century. the film keeps your interest without the added hollywood myths. the whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in america when it was mostly a rural nation. with this film, you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago. in a beautiful, scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive, as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure. see this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. this film is worth your time to see. my only question is - why aren't there more films like this one?. Unfortunately, many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores \"adjusted\" by imdb. this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde, little big man, night moves, mickey one, and the chase.if you click in the user rating area, you'll see that the actual median for four friends is 7.6. however, imdb has \"adjusted\" (dumbed down?) the rating to 6.4.per imdb: \"imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages. various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at 'vote stuffing' by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it....the exact methods we use will not be disclosed. this should ensure that the policy remains effective.\" in other words, we won't disclose our methods, so you can't question how we arrived at the score! what a shame to see fine thought-provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to imdb's \"filters\". Disney's buena vista pictures presents a wonderfully told fact-based sports drama directed by actor bill paxton. photography is superb, but story sometimes lumbers along. this film is about the 20 year old amateur golfer francis ouimet(shia labeouf)and his competition in the 1913 u.s. open. what a story; a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best golfers of the time, including british champions harry vardon(stephen dillane)and ted ray(stephen marcus). a storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat. the cast also includes: peter firth, elias koteas, marnie mcphail, robin wilcox, and possibly stealing the show is josh flitter, who plays eddie lowery, ouimet's caddy and best friend. Everything about this movie is perfect. the set design, the acting, the camera movement, the mood, the colors - everything. you'll be hard pressed to find a better movie. easily, the best film generated in the last 35 years. keep an eye on michael almereydas!!. I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when i heard it: an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking. it sparked my interest, but i never expected it to be this great. before sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. to my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. it's impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like my dinner with andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not just the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. see it!. The apolitical musicians eva (liv ullmann) and jan rosenberg (max von sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent. they provide lingenberry to a couple of costumers to raise some money and buy some supplies. they love each other and eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but the reluctant jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. when the rebels arrive in the island, their peaceful and calm lives turn to hell, and they get in the middle of accusations from both sides. when colonel jacobi (gunnar björnstrand) stalks eva, jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection they feel for each other change to hatred and indifference.\"shame\" is an antiwar movie by the master ingmar bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of artists that are apolitical and does not listen to the news, but when the war arrives to their lands, they have their love, friendship and affection destroyed by the senseless soldiers. liv ullmann and max von sydow have top-notch performances as usual and i do not recall seeing the breast of liv ullmann in any other movie. the process of brutalization of the pacific and sensitive jan rosenberg by the war is impressive and the bleak open conclusion is pessimist and adequate to the dramatic story. my vote is nine.title (brazil): \"vergonha\" (\"shame\"). Drum scene is wild! cook, jr. is unsung hero of this and many movies. fantastic actor, great flick. a few twists that keep you moving. a must-see. What impressed me the most about \"one true thing\" was how up-front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. as depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2/3 into the movie (\"love story\" \"terms of endearment\", etc.). meryl streep, renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge. the characters they play seem human; they're not perfect people. (arguably, one might not say that about the \"martha stewart\"-type character streep plays but throughout the film, i found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) \"one true thing\" is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned. This film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the way they didn't quite come together. i don't know who made it, but it has a slightly disney-esque feel. while parts of it are improbable (like when a pre-teen runs for a public office) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normalcy (whatever that is) to keep things balanced and in perspective. the acting is alright. strangely, the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit...off. it's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend, her grandmother, and her two passions: ballet and baseball. being a baseball player myself, it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys, but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces. i read somewhere that she isn't really ballerina, but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful. overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star mischa barton didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in \"lawn dogs\", \"lost and delirious\", and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in \"the 6th sense.\". The \"hunting trilogy\" of rabbit fire (1951), rabbit seasoning (1952), and duck! rabbit! duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the chuck jones-michael maltese collaboration. while they are seldom mentioned in lists of the \"greatest\" or \"most important\" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly the funniest cartoons i've ever seen. michael maltese never got the credit that directors like jones, freleng or avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make warner bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the funniest ever made. The mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. i only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience. mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. casual gamers: this game is more than worth the buy. 9.8 out of 10. Kolchak is sheer entertainment. great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down. darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him. simon oakland, jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having. some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes - erik estrada in legacy of terror, phil silvers in horror in the heights, antonio fargas in the zombie. it's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files. darren - rip. simon - rip. ruth - rip. It gives the ordinary guy/girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars.for the majority of the time, they sound like the singer they are meant to be portraying.another twist to it - a team of make up people and costumers dress the contestant up like that singer. they might not look like them but the likelihood of getting someone that sounds like a person looking exactly the same as them are very slim.it's a load of fun for your saturday night - and the contestants aren't raging wannabes like they are on another tv singing show. the fact that there are no prizes involved and it is for fun means that it will attract a different type of person.the only gripe i have is with the kids version - it looks like they have done the round of stage schools- what happened to the normal kids?. This film is hard to knock. it follows in the tradition of pulp fiction, yet succeeds further by stamping its own unique style. the cast is awesome, the script is great - and things like the odd (pulp fiction-esque) time-sequencing is done brilliantly. i particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time. when it is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool, but when it is the hero's recollection everything is skanky and disgusting.this is an awesome film - and so i am extremely annoyed to find that i cant buy it anywhere!. I can't believe how many people hate hal sparks! he was my favorite host of the show, hands down. i hate celebrity gossip and generally dislike talk shows, but when hal sparks hosted talk soup, it was must see tv for me. i rarely missed an episode during his run, and was saddened when the guest hosts started pouring in (although most of the guests still did a fine job). anyway, for all the people who dislike hal sparks, i imagine they must have never seen the weekend specials. they were hour long episodes of talk soup that comprised the best clips from the entire week, and were padded out by sketch comedy bits. the original bits that hal sparks did were hilarious. in one he got possessed by a bad comedy demon, and in an exorcist like scene his head spun as he told dated jokes about airline food. one episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplicity, as a bunch of cloned hal sparks kept multiplying through out the episode, over-running the studio.ok, maybe these don't sound as funny when i describe them, but all i know is that besides talk soup, the only other two shows i watched consistently during those years was the simpsons and late night with conan o'brian. so if you like the comedy stylings of those shows, then you'd probably like talk soup during the sparks years.that said, henson and tyler were both great hosts as well. all three hosts brought something different to the table but they were all fine comedians in my opinion. of course, throughout the tyler and guest star years, my interest in this show began to wane, but every now and then i catch the soup, the show's spiritual successor, and sure enough, the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from time to time.ok, i've wasted enough time talking about a tv show that isn't on the air anymore and on a channel that i generally despise. go watch something else!. I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after seinfeld,after elr and after friends. those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.koqs came at the end of this special time in tv. but don't let that dissuade you.king of queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. i never laughed so hard than i did at seinfeld. but koqs comes real close.when it comes to laughing, i have to rate koqs second only to seinfeld. elr has to be second though as the character creation and interaction is more endearing.either way, koqs is top ten of the last 20 years.the only other sitcom worth mentioning now is two and a half men which really doesn't hold a candle to the other four but is all we have left. Keys to the vip, an original series by the canadian comedy network (comedynetwork.ca) scored big with this entertaining, yet inspirational gameshow. this show is hosted by four funny, good-looking guys who judge others on their 'game' (ability to pick up women). each episode features two guys who go head-to-head in various pick-up games. there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a vip in an exclusive toronto night-club.being a guy, i naturally find this show hilarious. we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men. the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few pointers -- if you pay attention. If tv was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! with an excellent cast, and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to tv after dinner. with the constant changing of relationships and finding out who hyde's real dad is, this show was a hit when it started in august of 98, though it was set in 1976. and hanging out in foremans basement was always the thing to do back then, and it still is today, along with circles.this show gave great laughs in premieres, and it still does during re-runs. if you watch a few episodes of this show, you will get everything and want to get more. now only is this show one of the best ever created, it is clever and funny. I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. and... wouah! the pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie abbyss ? anyway, it's remarkable. sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on tv, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. the only downside is the commentary. in french it's narrated by françois perrin, usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries, but the text is not good at all. not enough informative of too much, innapropriatly anthropoid... I must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time, and i was not disappointed. the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic. as a part insomniac myself, i can relate with how the story develops. i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary. it was a great film, worth every penny. i hope that one day i can work with tess myself, it would be an honor and beyond. i can recommend it for everybody. maybe not small children as they may get scared. but if you are an insomniac like me, you'll understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. you'll love it. f. I picked this up in the 'danger after dark' box set, and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt. i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america. instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that sho (gackt) develops through the movie as a person. the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards.on a side note, taro yamamoto's performance was very surprising. the only other film i've seen him in is battle royale, where he plays shogo kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo. toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. so, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with battle royale, you'll be very surprised by him.but don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. it's just a movie with a vampire in it. that hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene. it's a really moving picture at some points, the photography is really well done. it's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at blockbuster. I came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one. it deals with issues that most directors shy away from, my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn't buy a copy for my friend!it's a touching story about how people with eating disorders don't necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies. it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of. Let's get one thing straight, this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun'd by everyone else. i went in with one promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and it delivers! the gore itself is really good, and the characters have awesome roles. come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs, even a electrical engineer getting his pimp on! you get to see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore, and a mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face!! as i mentioned and many others have, the movie pacing is a bit off, but respectable nonetheless. movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this. there can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. it could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as alien lock-down or boa vs python, but those are some big shoes to fill. a solid 7 out of 10. Telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica! i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica! it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil. the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful. xica contains a lot of history of that time period. i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning. i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo. i've e-mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica. overall xica merits a 10 out of 10!. If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . in fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect , beauty and soul of powell and pressburger's masterpiece . the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . raf bomber command lost 58,000 men during the war , the same number that america lost in 'nam but during a shorter period and a far , far smaller pool of active combatants , there's no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if you'd lost a relative during the conflict you'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . when richar attenborough's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war . also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates . it's obvious nazis don't go to heaven the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext , you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it's replaced by american ambitions . there's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture . one is the ethnic mix of america , even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51% of americans are \" white european \" . the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess \" i am an american \" as peter is judged by abraham farlan , an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence . as for the \" special relationship \" between britain and america - what special relationship ? powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america . they obviously know their future too so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . it's strange , beautiful , poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq ?. It's hard to say which comes out on top, james cagney's charm and energy or the mouth- opening excesses of busby berkeley's three grand showstoppers at the close. i give it a tie, with footlight parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early thirties musicals. although the movie clearly belongs to cagney, joan blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line. and what's the story line? it's about chester kent (cagney) who produces musicals, and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over. he starts doing prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts. he gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them, moving them around the country. he's a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things. but a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; nan prescott (blondell), his wise-cracking secretary, loves him but he's too busy too notice; an office girl in black-rimmed, round glasses (ruby keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all; a blonde gold-digger is setting her hooks in him; his partners are cheating him...my gosh, what's next? this may all sound like a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, with cagney bouncing, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it's done. instead of \"let's put on a show, gang\" we have \"we need to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing.\" these three super prologues are going to feature 40 chorines, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty kent units in deluxe movie houses...the whole apollo movie house circuit! exhaustion threatens, feet ache, but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes (which include ann sothern and dorothy lamour; you can quickly spot sothern but lamour is more generic) stay the course, dancing their hearts out, giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty. and then the curtains go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie houses, one after the other on the same night, with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save chester's skin or not. first up is \"honeymoon hotel\" with dick powell and ruby keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some might even be married), bedrooms and beds, and doors with \"do not disturb\" signs. then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of \"by a waterfall\" that probably had the warner brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy. this number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with waterslides, a giant pool -- you'd never think there was a depression on. berkeley pulls out all his tricks -- synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things -- and he does it in the water, with a lot of underwater photography looking up. the girls are sure game. they come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks. the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. ruby keeler, who has a couple of quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks a bit cautious. and finally, the smash finale...11 minutes of cagney dancing and singing with keeler to \"shanghai lil,\" with all sorts of bar girls and their customers, unusual in that the races are mixed up. there's cagney and keeler dancing on the bar, dancing on a table, cagney fighting. there are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines, hupping back and forth, rifles tossed and caught. then...this is true...a human picture forms of franklin roosevelt and the nra eagle. this may be the only hollywood musical production that has ever featured roosevelt, a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy chinese prostitutes. that's entertainment, folks. it's great! of course, chester's prologues get the big contract and nan gets chester. the movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. ruby keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along. joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality. the movie, however, belongs to cagney, who grabs and shakes it, and to berkeley, a man for whom too much was never too much. It is written in stone that disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals. right? where? show me. because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard disney musical fare. while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been, it was still quite good, enjoyable, and adventurous. i had hoped for a bit more, yes, considering the subject matter, but this movie is ~not~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be. the animation quality is average, but the dialog is quite compelling, as is the story line, plot, sub-plot, and amazing creativity i found within this production. i will refrain from outlining the plot, as it has been done and done, but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy.this is, in my opinion, the best disney animated feature length film.it rates a 9.4/10 from...the fiend :. Just watched this movie on dvd and thought the acting was very good, but the over all story left a lot to be desired. this movie has the same texture and look of panic in needle park or drugstore cowboy. hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle; on the underbelly of society, in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use, crime, violence, sex, and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or anything, including themselves.val kilmore is outstanding in his role of \"burnt-out\" former porn star john holmes. the supporting cast is just as good. however, this is a bleak, dark, disturbing, and depressing film. the murder was brutal, but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well. unless you have an interest in these murders or were a \"fan\" of john holmes, this really isn't a film to see. if you want to see a docu-drama on murder, truman capote's 1960s in cold blood starring scott wilson and robert blake is much better. The movie touches the soul of the audience very much,some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically,i'm surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year 1925.as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage.first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is.lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films.and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie.\n"

      "Concatenated Negative Reviews:\n",
      " I recently viewed manufactured landscapes at the seattle international film festival. i was drawn to the movie as a photographer because i'm both familiar and a fan of burtynsky's work. while i believe the movie does a good job getting it's message across, i couldn't help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by burtynsky. obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them. while this is a good effect when used economically, i felt like 75% of the movie was just stills from burtynsky's book (which i already own). that's probably an exaggeration, but that's how i felt. if you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one. I figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird. necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it's own good. the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists/witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them. the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. by the finale, there are too many unanswered questions. what's worse, as the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters. it seems odd that welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesn't have that much to do. maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie. now that would really be fun!. Run away from this movie. even by b-movie standards this movie is dreadful. it is also insidious in it's theme. the main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring. people who treat others with respect are losers. guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie, see it instead.no normal kid would do what trent does. state troopers do not work as they do in this film etc. seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche. mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker,who yes, has had a terrible life. however, she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her.usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for, in this case there is none. it is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters. the acting is adequate by b-movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting. Oh dear. i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japan's ringu. well, i guess the u.s. made their version of it as well, but at least it was an outright remake. so, so sad. i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country, so i can't believe this had to happen. claudine and kris are such big names there, surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism. to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines: you do not have to stoop this low to make money. there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them!. Below average blaxpoitation action / melodrama in which the lovely ms. grier plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father (rudy challenger) and his partner (austin stoker of the original \"assault on precinct 13\") whose loan business is being threatened.i'll be frank - i agree with the few other user comments for this movie. \"sheba, baby\" has a less than satisfying script, direction that isn't particularly distinguished, action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best, and one of ms. grier's more nondescript supporting casts (although there's an important supporting role for d'urville martin, also a familiar name in blaxpoitation). i get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularity.it sure was cool seeing stoker again, although ms. grier doesn't have as good a role - or dialog - as she has had in other films, although she is doing what she does best, and that's playing a sassy, sexy sister on a mission of vengeance.non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is enjoyable, at the very least.mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the pam grier film repertoire.4/10. I'm not sure why i disliked this film so much. maybe i'm too old or too male or too something. just who was the target audience here? if you're it and you liked it, then i'm happy for you. personally, i found it a bit of a pill. the characters were uninteresting and unlikeable, the script was just plain embarrassing and some, though not all, of the acting was uninspired. mawkish, tedious and occasionally nauseating -- surely there's something better on.on a related issue: why is it that whenever i see chris klein in a film i get an urge to slap him silly? does anyone else get that?. The only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining. i would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again. even for a tv movie it is flat. the cast is boring. the screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand. how two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. there is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the omen franchise, and it is shot in slo-mo and cut short at the anticipated pay-off. if you are tempted to see this, pop it in, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy. with any luck you'll doze off quickly, and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over. namely, this movie. Going into this i was expecting anything really good, but after the damage this inflexed on me, i'm just happy to think strait. it's hard to think what the film-makers( ha!) this was a good movie. the stories, and i use the world loosely, are incoherent and do make any sense at all. there just stupid things that happen at random. the acting, if can be called acting is horrible i've seen batter acting in toy ads! i know it's a low-budget video-bin garbages, but still even it's not like they tried. will after stetting thought it, i feel very sleepy and still #yawws# do, i'm going to go lie down.warnning: do not atemp to drive, walk, read or do any after watching chillers. other side affectts may enguled lose of any or all metal funkions. Two l.a cops track down a serial killer nicknamed \"the family man\" who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the deep six, questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn't responsible but rather mobsters. the idea of seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, indeed one could see seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous. also a running joke involves wayon's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place. not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage, due to a boy's breakup with his girlfriend. after seagal neutralizes him, the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him. now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this, if you want your girlfriend back, taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side. i myself would think flowers or the old fashioned phone call might work, then again though, i'm old fashioned. besides who am i to put a damper on somebody else's brilliant reconciliation plan.* out of 4-(bad). This is movie is garbage, it looked really funny on the previews but i didn't laugh once through the whole movie. do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this, don't waste anyone's money on this. i gave it a 1/10 believe me i would have given it less if i could have. i'm a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back. This movie was made because the concept translates well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure investors. that is, the premise is interesting and sellable. i mean, i rented it based on the synopsis. the problem is there is nothing beyond the initial concept. there is no coherent plot, no fully fledged characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises, and no good performances (except jon herder, he does something with very little). it's as if the people who green lit this thing never read the script but only the synopsis. and if there were enough people like me, it may even have made money.to the prospective viewer: don't waste your time, there is nothing funny or interesting to see here. to the creators of the film: hey, you got your film made, so what if its not that great. most people never get to see themselves or their work up on screen. I read the novel 'jane eyre' for the first time back in 1986. it was round that time that i saw the bbc-version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke. it was an excellent version and very much like the book. years later, i laid eyes on this version and was horrified. william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester. mr rochester is a passionate character, where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice. the same goes for charlotte gainsborough. it was like watching two zombies together. this is story about love and passion, but i couldn't see it in this version. no, back to the bbc-version. a wonderful time is guaranteed. Uta hagen's \"respect for acting\" is the standard textbook in many college theater courses. in the book, hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentational approach, and the representational approach. in the presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. in the representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound.the representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made. british theater has a long history of this style of acting, and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational school.time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach. to the modern eye, olivier's highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet, olivier made a declaiming, self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamlet.and so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of hamlet's lines unintentionally funny: \"in-stead, you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it... smooth-ness!\" instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost (as any proper actor could), bright fill lights in olivier's pupils give us that impression.eileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet, putting in a good essay at the queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given olivier's tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn. final analysis: \"i would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing termagant; it out-herods herod: pray you, avoid it.\". I just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening (i work for an independent theatre chain in colorado - it's one of the perks)...i'm sorry, but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen! i know that there are some bruce campbell fanatics out there who (like star wars die-hards) will string you up from the nearest tree if you dare speak any ill of their beloved cinematic icon...nevertheless, campbell-teers, this particular work from the chin is a celluloid black hole.before you make any assumptions that i'm some hoity-toity film buff who only watches \"real\" movies like \"ladies in lavender\" and \"sideways\", think again - i'm a huge fan of b-movies, and bruce campbell in particular. his trademark character ash is one of my favorites, and his portrayal of the aging elvis in bubba ho-tep was phenomenal.but hey, b-movies still have the potential to be reeeeally, reeeeally bad (and not in that \"good\" campy way we all love)...and that's what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow co-workers. with the exception of that one tracking shot where bruce runs through the square and scares the kids, there were no laughs to be had. overall, we found the story to be mind-numbingly stoopid, the pacing mollasses-like, and the so-called humor dumber than a bag of hammers. (i'm sorry, but ted raimi's \"pavel\" character was not comic relief...he was just plain retarded!) believe me, we all went into this really wanting to like it, but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours.if you absolutely loved this movie, plan to see it multiple times, want to marry and have kids with it, etc., that's fantastic - we all like what we like, so you get no judgement from me. but don't go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having multiple orgasms over campbell's latest cinematic coupe. this flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble opinion...and as a true campbell fan, i'm allowed to say that!. Wow !! i didn't even know about this movie until i was searching for the name of another mark hamill classic (time runner). some things are better left unknown. mark hamill's role is quite ... limited. i would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of vincent price and christopher lee in those bad horror b-movies of the 60's and 70's. in those movies, they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. memorable acting by mark with such great lines as \"don't try to run. you're under arrest.\" did i mention he says that exact thing more than once. bill paxton fell into an uzumaki type spiral of drugs and booze after aliens, because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session. the hair .. the hair !!! .. priceless bill. truly should have been \"game over\" for bill .. but somehow .. he got treatment .. and went on to better??? movies. this movie blows. it is more dull and boring than the crazies. at least that movie was crazy... this is just boring. do not watch this movie sober. Oh dear. this movie could have been sub-titled \"when writers go on strike!\" what a stinker. i had really high hopes for this, mostly after reading imdb reviews, which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system, but that's a separate matter. i loved steve carrell in anchorman, bruce almighty, the office, etc so i was expecting great things. to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year. there are so many things wrong with this movie, but i'll confine myself to (a) the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do (a mass aerobics workout? what planet is that real life on?), the clunky script (a murderer of love? please), and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable, you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue, creaking direction, ridiculous set-scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. we would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents, who don't get out much and don't like to waste money. unlike the makers of this movie, who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire - that would have been more entertaining. if you like movies, avoid this like the plague. You know you're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives. it all goes downhill from there. unnecessary, \"matrix\"-influenced bullet-time camera work. pointless cuts to video game footage. crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen. ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye. even the zombies are boring.i was hoping for at least a \"so bad it's good\" zombie movie, but this one is \"so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie again\". I loved the gorgeous greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can follow anyway, was even harder to follow in the movie. i cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why australian allison turned into french anne, and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story. the mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie. i saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then, since i had read the book several times. i recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies i like) who was mostly amazed at how young michael caine and candace bergen were in it, but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery. What a waste of time! i've tried to sit through 'sky captain..\" about 6 times, and every time, within about 3 minutes, i start doing something else - anything else! it's a downright boring movie, the acting is terrible, the writing dull, and obviously a first-time director, because it's stiff. and i wanted to love it. i love sci-fi, the old cliffhangers, and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon, and metropolis, but my god, what a waste of money. i used to work for paramount pictures, and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. she told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later, paramount releases this piece of crap. sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. blue screen an effect shot, but not an entire movie. let's not forget, neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors (but easy on the eyes). paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. too bad - it could've worked, but only under a skilled director. the funny thing is, sky captain's director will keep getting work, even after this dreck. it's commerce, not art!. Van sant copies hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets: a walkman, and nudity from anne heche. unless you have a strong desire to see ms. heche naked there is absolutely no reason to see this film instead of the original. hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and van sant fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore, the original shower scene is all the more terrifying. ask janet leigh about that one. the acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive. One of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen. matt dillon was awesome once again, but the rest didn't played a bigger part as they should have.it was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end.its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens.if you have absolutely nothing to do, you can give it a try i personally found it not worth watching. the story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a b-movie by engineering a happy ending. \"the rainmaker\" released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. katharine hepburn, lloyd bridges, and burt lancaster being the principle players. not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. first of all, hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. she is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. lancaster over acts to the extreme, and earl holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like jethro clampett. only bridges and the ever reliable wendell corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. it seems like the 1950's was a time when katharine hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. she just made a bad choice here. fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didn't make too many of them. despite an a-list cast and good production values, it doesn't work. Underwoods goofy story about a young man(arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr. (nicholas). the film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, arquette is annoying throughout, ian nicholas was nonexistent, macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable. this is a stupid film in my eyes, boring at times, not entertaining, just a film that i wouldn't recommend to anybody. imdb rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10. *spoiler alert!* it just gets to me the nerve some people have to remake (and i use the term loosely here..) good movies. in the american version of this dutch thriller, someone decided the original ending wasn't pasteurized enough for american audiences. so what do they do? they create a new one! a stupid, improbable, i-pretend-i'm-dead-but-come-to-life-again-so-the-good-guy-can-kick-my-butt- some-more kind of ending. do yourself a favor and get the original one. Doug mcclure has starred in a few of these british produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot . i know the land that time forgot has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values . that's the problem with this movie - the production values go way beyond \" so bad they're good \" affectionate territory and become \" so bad i think i'll go and see what's on the other channels \" one case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid cushing and mcclure encountering a monster . it's painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection . it becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot . have i mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces ? no really this looks like it was filmed in somebody's living room with the spare change left over from that year's doctor who budget . even former doctor who peter cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line \" you can't mesmerise me - i'm british \" is delivered in a very flat way ( a very similar line is spoken by cushing in horror express ) in a script devoid of characterisation , plotting and memorable dialogue . it's not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable it's also infrequent and rare since the monsters don't speak . wouldn't it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in warlords of atlantis so that they could explain the plot . does anyone here know what the plot actually is ? a very tedious british movie that even the twin talents of caroline munro can not save . the whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops. Let me first say, i watched this movie around midnight, and usually there only is trash around this hour, but this movie broke the recordfirst of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy, yet he gets to f*ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop, talks to a girl and then you see them f*cksecondly there are loads of sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity at all, i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say: fast put your clothes on so we can f*ck!thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family, this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash. The giant claw is in fierce competition with films like, 'robot monster' and 'plan 9 from outer space' for worst film of all time. a phony looking giant vulture attacks 'lionel trains' in this completely unconscious film. the script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. it's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie, \"it came from hollywood,\" where this gem is hammered for the line, 'a bird as big as a battleship', with gleeful, endless needling. the line pops up relentlessly through the course of the film, so there's no escaping it. there are several shots from, 'the beast from 20,000 fathoms' and 'earth vs. the flying saucers' among other sci-fi films from the 50's to beef up the scraggly vulture's attacks. at one point the big vulture is responsible for a few deaths, so the military puts the entire world under martial law and no one is allowed to go out of their homes. of course, the huge buzzard is mainly concerned with pursuing the stars of this classic, jeff morrow & mara corday, wherever they might be. yet the director is so lame that he doesn't even provide for a few honey shots of pretty mara in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the tedium of this zero star thriller. that's the second time this blunder has been made. in 'tarantula', mara corday struts around in hot dresses for the whole film, but is relegated to pants throughout, 'the giant scorpion'. the budget for this film must have been not more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and i doubt whether morrow or corday got more than three thousand to make it. it looks like the whole thing was shot right out of somebody's garage. Most of the episodes on season 1 are awful..there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits, as they programs actually had decent story lines. most of amazing stories are well dull..not amazing in the least..go rent or buy the twilight zone series...i have heard season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the dvd's they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation. the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985...most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering... Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat, let loose by another one of those facilities conducting mad science. gereco biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research, accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate.b-movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill \"genetic mistake monster movie\". costas mandylor evokes mick dundee, aussie accent, hat, big ass knife, the works, as a croc specialist hired by gereco executive joanna pacula(..wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people). charles napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and jane longenecker is his hot daughter, who works at the animal shelter. soap opera star matthew borlenghi is longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures(..his brother is a victim of the croc). of course, this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.the croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low grade variety. in regards to roger corman productions dealing with renegade dino-monsters, i stick with carnosaur. the monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it's hind legs, often upright as it pursues potential victims. i felt mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter, and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails. borlenghi and longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen. as expected, pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion(..gulp). They have taken a story dear to the people of edinburgh's heart, a true story and changed it as hollywood has done before to many a tale. the end result is a movie however well done for those how do not know the story yet totally different and inaccurate. the original movie of this tale that walt disney himself oversaw used the right breed dog that is crucial for this tale and did not make that john grey was anything special he was a poor shepard who died in poverty at the inn. if you like the story, watch the disney original for a better heart- warming story. it's a shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific remake of a classic tale. read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story. and if you really like it, you can visit the real kirkyard in edinburgh. \"sir\" john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one.;this is one of those films, i suppose, that is considered \"art,\" but don't be fooled.....it's garbage. stick to the \"art\" you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this.in this masterpiece, giegud recites shakespeare's \"the tempest\" while the camera pans away to nude people. one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool. wow, this is heady stuff and real \"art,\" ain't it?? that's just one example. most of the story makes no sense, is impossible to follow and, hence, is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't \"understand\" so they give it high marks to save their phony egos. you want shakespeare? read his books. One missed call, another asian horror based on the cell phone. i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called \"pon\". one missed call was just as boring as that one. maybe phones just aren't scary or something, but this move was dull and drab. no tension or thrills for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, and felt too long. didn't keep my attention. it seems phones are hard to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie. and it is ridiculous to compare this with \"the ring\", it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven't seen any that measure up in the least. to horror directors - take the phone off the hook as a horror device. How sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film. tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason seems truly frightened. i can understand her fear; fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public. also, i'm a fan of the likable adam west. again, as with tina, adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age. his acting here is passable, but the script is so bad, that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog.the movie is a rip-off of the classic brando biker flick, the wild ones; out-law biker gang is out-of-control in a small hick-town. the bikers here look like a motley group and i sure wouldn't want them to date my sister. the acting is stiff and wooden, and the story-plot is as old as sand. hellriders is hell to watch!. Probably encouraged by admirers of her much-better \"orlando\", potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and actually co-writes the music, including a mawkish love song. the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her. but potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango. perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked. she just can't act, whether playing herself or not. pretentious, over-ambitious, dull, and silly. I appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film, but this is too much. in the end they look like a bunch of loonies. this film is one of those finding yourself 70's plots, i know the film is made in 1980. a lot more of clint and girl friend movie. this movie is a 3/10. ... mainly because ju-on 2 boasts an outrageous forty minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes, that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film. ho-hum. i found that deeply irritating - as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff! - not to mention dull, having to watch it all over again.ok, that complaint aside, the byline for ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie, which frankly, over 36 minutes, simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline.there are, however, some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been, had it had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some, but not all - are answered.so in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story, go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minutes. During the first 3 seasons fairly odd parents was as tasty as hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. now it's as tasty as pepto-bismol. and unfortunately pepto-bismol is what you'll need after viewing the more recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs. cosmo, once one of the more endearing nick characters, has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of family guy wouldn't even want to know. timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that bart simpson would happily beat the snot out of (and given timmy's snottiness, that would take a lot of beating). and poor wanda...a real charmer who's become the victim of her husband and godchild, she's now labeled a \"nag\" for caring about the well-being of others. plus cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he's never punished for it, nor does he learn any lessons. which pretty much sums up butch hartman's attitude towards kids: they're crude, vulgar and not too bright. thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled, along with butch hartman's darling, danny phantom. at least butch got what he deserved - unlike cosmo. Five across the eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it. soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them, makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off. shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas...produced & directed by greg swinson & ryan theissen with swinson writing the thing & theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing i have to say that five across the eyes is easily one of the worst films i have ever seen if not the worst, i mean i'm struggling to think of a film i have seen that's worse. now let me start off by saying that i am sure a lot of the film-making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of five across the eyes that i didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on youtube & even then it's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that i could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers. the reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the imdb (the amount of 1 star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right?) & it's message board which i think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase 'the worst film i have ever seen' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & i have to agree with them. the story is terrible, alright i suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? there's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random. it goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature. the dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot. oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly. then there's the real killer, the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & five across the eyes is a film that i hated with a passion.on a technical level again i can see that the film-making style here was a deliberate choice but i have to be honest again & say five across the eyes is the worst looking film i have ever seen. as a fan of film i like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium & i definitely don't want them to look worse than the average youtube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while i was drunk. it really does look that amateurish & that bad, it's a complete eyesore & i hated every moment of every second of it. just think the blair witch project (1999) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there. there are times during five across the eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera-work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels. the violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.low budget doesn't even begin to describe five across the eyes, with a supposed budget of about $4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release. the two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations. the acting is pretty bad by the main cast, i just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely.five across the eyes will go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen & i have seen a few films, whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film i have ever seen five across the eyes will definitely get a mention. i hated it, every single aspect & wretched moment of it. Let's get right to the heart of the matter...this is a terrible movie. the story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the lead actors look like they were forced to be in it. the story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. ellen barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on peta wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. the sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when barkin and wilson kiss, poor ellen looks like she's in pain. barkin's talent is totally wasted in this b-grade sexploitation piece of junk and i hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this film. Being a fan of marlene dietrich's films, i was very anxious to see this \"documentary.\" i also got sucked in by reading rave review after rave review from the national critics. that should have tipped me off.the movie is just plain boring and obviously extremely overrated. you don't even see dietrich. she is heard in the background, discussing her movies and this video. she does almost nothing but complain about everything. what a drag! the filmmaker, maximilian schell, constantly complains himself and pleads with her to be on camera.....all to no avail. she just keeps refusing to cooperate. after awhile, this sort of thing gets really tiring. with her attitude, why would schell continue with this project? he should have just told the prima donna to \"shove it.\"regardless of what you read, do not waste your time with this. Despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago, i have never come across this italian \"sword and sorcery\" item on late-night italian tv and, now that i have seen it for myself, i know exactly why. not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the dark ages after all)it is, quite simply, very poor stuff indeed. in fact, i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and, believe me, i have seen plenty (especially in the last few years i.e. following my excursion to the 2004 venice film festival)! reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore, i can see their point: i may prefer fulci's earlier \"giallo\" period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but, even on the latter, his commitment was arguably unquestionable. on the other hand, conquest seems not to have inspired fulci in the least  seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist, sprinkle it with incongruent characters (cannibals vs. werewolves, anyone?), irrelevant gore (we are treated to a gratuitous, nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists!) and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked, brain-slurping villainess (don't ask) and her slimy reptilian pet!! for what it is worth, we have two heroes for the price of one here: a young magic bow-carrying boy on some manhood-affirming odyssey (andrea occhipinti) and his rambling muscle-bound companion (jorge rivero i.e. frenchy from howard hawks' rio lobo [1970]!) who, despite being called mace (short for maciste, perhaps?), seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protégé out of trouble (particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the 'boils'). unfortunately, even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex-goblin claudio simonetti's electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times. fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness (after defeating one and all with the aid of the all-important magic bowso much for his own supposed physical strength!) onto his next  and thankfully unfilmed  adventure!. Non existent plot, tons of poorly directed / super-cheesy scenes (snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can't even hit their targets a few feet away? plus what's up with the ending?---> a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival's shooting gallery? wth?), technical mistakes (how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock? 100+? these people fire their guns without the need of reloading). the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael biehn (aliens, terminator) can't save this junk.do not watch this movie (i realized that i wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one). hopefully the director would either stop making movies, or learn more for his next movie. I did here this movie was good from various people. plus i do like natalie portman and javier bardem as well as the director milos forman. yet after watching this movie i really had nothing to admire about it.first off the acting was very much below average. the performances were just not powerful enough to really feel shocked by what the inquisition did. javier bardem did give a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had as spanish accent. it is pretty obvious why this bardem was the only one. natalie portman, who i think is a very good up and coming actress did not really make me feel sorry for her being tortured. like the movie there was nothing to admire about her performance. stellan skarsgaard who i do like gave a very average performance, like the other actors giving a boring performance. this movie was essentially about him since he plays goya. yet he did not become what he needed to be to make this movie good. what about randy quaid? you have just got to be kidding me. him playing king carlos iv. look he is great in comedies but him playing a king that just describes the whole movie for you.the directing was just horrible in this movie. when a movie is a mess there are usually two people to blame for that: the director and the writer. i get the feeling that milos forman really didn't want his actors to put a spanish accent on. from the very few battle scenes in here they were all displayed horribly. also as a director he needs to give you the feeling of shock of what the inquisition did. after this movie i felt like i could careless about the event. to sum it all up he poorly shot the scenes and misguided the actors.the writing which was also done by milos forman was just as bad or maybe even worse than the directing. there really was nothing memorable of the movie except for one seen where bardem does get the same treatment that portman's character has gotten. other then that the movie did not give you the feeling of the time period and at least it could have made up for it with a quote or two.after finishing this movie i was just looking at the t.v. thinking ok why should i care about any of this. i do care and are very much interested in history but when movies like this come up it feels like the producers robbed you of something good that could have been taken away from the movie. when movies are this bad we highlight a lot of the technical faults in a movie than if it was good. like the accents. i'm not sure people would have emphasized the lack of spanish accents if this movie was good.thw whole point of this review is to say just don't watch it. This movie has beautiful scenery. unfortunately it has no plot. in order to have a plot there must be a conflict. this movie had none. it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it. the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling.if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story. there isn't one. John madden's cinematic interpretation of edith wharton's ethan frome falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece. while the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film. madden fails to convey the innocence, and overall tragedy of ethan and mattie's relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale. the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog. zeena (zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the books least sympathetic figure, where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on. the book more accurately describes zeena's tyrannical control of the house and of ethan. the movie just ticked me off. the addition of the fox was pointless, as well as the scene with mattie trying to kill herself. it was just poorly interpreted and done. film mistakes: ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with denis eady, addition of love scene, fox scene, store scene, saying his plans allowed, lack of displays of ethan's inner emotions and thoughts, introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer, let on to much that zeena knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what zeena is thinking or aware of. just too many flaws and poor directing decisions. This movie is a real waste of time and effort. the film lacks plot and depth. the visuals are decent but nothing to write home about. there are far better films out there. I remembered the title so well. to me, it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles. and it had vincent massey's voice from behind whiskers. well flora robson was great. her next signature, for me, would be \"55 days at peking\". the same role but with different sumptuous gowns. and the same voice. as for the armada, it was a subtext. i like black-and-white films. was everything done in elizbethan times at night? it was talky and difficult to fathom, at times. i couldn't tell which was the love interest. was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh? and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada. apparently it worked for the empire, but not for the script. this might have been more accurate, historically, but bette davis had more engaging scripts. and i missed daylight!. This movie started out with some semblance of a plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. it was impossible to remain engaged with this film. this movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability. it is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio. clearly there are morale and motivation problems at disney, not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control. that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation. this movie joins my very short \"worst movies of all time\" list. \"a damsel in distress\" is definitely not one of fred astaire's better musicals. but even astaire's bad films always had some good moments.in \"damsel,\" astaire is jerry halliday, an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour. he meets lady alice marshmorton (19-year-old joan fontaine), a beautiful english heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. he tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry. keggs (reginald gardiner) the conniving butler, and albert (harry watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice's romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet.this musical has numerous problems. first, there is the plot, based on a novel by p.g. wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). the story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. when fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) fred romancing joan fontaine or (b) keggs and albert conniving against them and each other.the butler and the house boy are especially irritating. they are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance.astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, ginger rogers. joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. she has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride, as jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done. at times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in london, not hollywood. (they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) on the plus side, the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. and of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to astaire and his choreographer, hermes pan.but the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. at times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (at one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) the numbers include:  \"i'm dancing and i can't be bothered now\" -- fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled london street. he does some great \"cane-twirling\" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (in the broadway musical, \"crazy for you,\" harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.) \"put me to the test\" -- fred, george, and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage. george and gracie match fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason. \"stiff upper lip\" (the fun house number) -- at an amusement park fun house, fred, george, and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. it's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times. \"things are looking up\" -- fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer. \"a foggy day in london town\" -- fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london. at times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself. \"nice work if you can get it\" -- a great song that is misused in the movie. during a social event at the manor house, fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. each time fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (again, harry groener did a better dance number with this song in \"crazy for you.\")  \"drum dance number\" -- as fred and joan are eloping, fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. as usual, it's a great dance number. but there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine. as he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. fred (or rather, a stuntman in fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote. the >>ff button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers. When people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said little. these children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film). lets start with the blonde - debbie - she's a slut of a girl, i mean come on she wears mini skirts, she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face. she acts so innocent. next we have the second child - the geek - who thinks he's so cool, with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile. the next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him. this film angered me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them. About the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end... i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would gel... alas...those who like gus van sant's films - especially his later ones - will probably like this. personally, i find van sant's films to be dull, pretentious and facile. well, he was an executive producer for this film, so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him - although personally i actually liked this better than van sant's latest efforts (e.g. elephant).contrary to many here, i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed, i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood - the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world - but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all. but i feel that the problem with the film is that \"mood\" is not enough... and not only that, but that the mood painted here is, to my mind, incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening. the dream-like quality, so closely linked to nature, is beautifully captured here, but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child, one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold (waves on a beach, grasses and flowers, spiders etc). the rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when i was about eight or nine. there is a languor to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life. when you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything but languorous! there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film...spoilers here - first when logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit. the frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me.the second, and only part of the film with any tension to it, were the scenes where \"leah\" (logan's re-creation of himself) phones rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone-sex. the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voice-over of \"leah\" was the most convincing actor in the entire film. (it made me think of claire danes from my so-called life ...the voice even sounded like claire.) she and rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids. and what i especially liked was the fact that rodeo only pretended to play along... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally! - we got some character development.all in all, a somewhat misplaced effort... we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director's possible talents. in the meantime, if he can get away from van sant's influence, it might do him a world of good. who is this director anyhow - one of van sant's boy toys?. I've always been a fan of chuck norris for what he's accomplished and his movies. for while i had been meaning to watch this film, but for whatever reason didn't have chance. apparently i didn't miss much. this has to be one of chuck's worst films. so this trucker, billy dawes (augenstein) is given the chance to make his delivery, but on the way he is detoured and forced into a jerkwater town where a foolish local corrupt judge trimmings (murdock) who runs the whole town, has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him. he denies the charges and makes a run for it. the local hick cops beat him and he disappears. but now his brother jd john dawes (norris) another trucker goes looking for him. he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town. in the meantime the female of the film calls on local truckers on a cb radio, and they all come rushing into town demolishing it. lol with there big rigs. eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs.this movie was pretty bad. it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops, because there such losers. but there is virtually no story, the acting is bad, and the ending ..well it doesn't really have one. the judge has his house rammed into by a big rig and you never know what happens. does he live? norris never even gets to trash him. in the meantime norris takes on some thug cop at the end. who cares? norris also manages to take on everyone in town, gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting. come on! this movie was apparently made to cash in on the cb craze of the time, why there was one is beyond me. they barley even use the cb's in the movie. adding to this, the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet. this movie is bad, but if you're bored and need something to watch it will pass the time. as far as norris he went on to make much better films than this. 3 out of 10. Why does c thomas howell do these movies? cruise (howell's one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of wotw and howell follows with this lame effort.where do i start here? production values - i'll start with the good stuff. the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. the set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.script - terrible. a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. the amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. very poor storyline (but so was the cruise wotw) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.special fx - okay, i don't want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges, washington, liner. but in the main the \"alien\" machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.acting - i'm a fan of howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the \"over-acting\" bug a long time ago. look at his performance in the hitcher and compare it to this movie. there is no comparison. he overdoes his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. hysterical. but after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green (zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. i honestly could not understand one word he said - i even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the dvd did not have subtitles. this seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film. none of them are good.direction - not bad but not good either.score - dismal.overall, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this, he won't have a career soon enough.3/10. This is the worst of the toxie series by far. the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. the major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. like there's a different girl friend of toxie's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick. why is this film made like a disney movie. after about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all. there's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop. after the films 20 minutes are up the film is bearly entertainment. h*ll it's bearly watchable. well unless your drunk then don't watch this film. you've been warned. There's no getting around it-- this movie is terrible. i've seen the old christopher lee/fu manchu movies, i'm familiar with the characters and it's serial origins, but it's still just godawful. however, peter sellers' genius still shines through with his portrayal of nayland smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy, and strength simmering through a stoic facade; it's a performance i place on par with peter cushing's portrayal of van helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all cushing's \"dracula\" movies. if the movie was done in a more serio-comic vein like bubba ho-tep by way of the 1960's avengers tv show, this could've been something special. if you're a fu manchu or peter sellers completest, this is something you need to see, but it's a pass for anyone else. Barney is that idiot dinosaur who (unfortunaltely) didn't go extinct with the other dinosaurs many eons ago. instead he sings stupid songs and has stupid morals about life that are 100% worthless and/or extremely dangerous: that is \"strangers are your friends you haven't met yet!\". the reason why i say he's evil? well, on youtube, there's a video of a barney song about toy balls. when it's played backwards, it comes out as \"we'll all come hang you! let's stab the knockers!\". don't believe me? see it for yourself! i also read on another review that they are now reading out pc folklore and fairy tales. now that is just stupid with a capital s! i mean, really! anyways, i don't recommend letting your kids watch this filth as it contains stupid morals like strangers are your friends (as said before), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad eat junk food, being an individual is taboo, magic can solve all of your problems and heaps of other ridiculous crap. What a pathetic movie.i won't waste much time commenting about it. i'm still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it.let me leave it simply with - shaq has no business being an actor or singer. he is utterly without talent at both discplines. it's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds.much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is shaq. It's a shame that they didn't trust the original enough to build on it. but \"robocop 2\" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offer.the beginning commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows (reminiscent of the beginning in \"guys and dolls\"!) but aside from a flash of thought here and there, this is one film that is a slow, dirty slog down into the middle of nowhere.ideas are introduced then dropped, interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here, most of the new characters (cain, juliette faxx) are so boring that they wouldn't hold up no matter what the movie, and then there's the tone.in the blessed original, paul verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude where if you cranked up the attitude and the sensibility of a good pulp comic, even the most repellent violence would be entertaining. kershner (although he did direct a \"star wars\" sequel) doesn't. and scene after scene either makes you cringe, look away or just tune it out altogether.and what's with robocop?? he should be the main thing here, right? but there's whole scenes where he doesn't even show up, and what scenes he is in are so half-thought and shakily written that you don't know or care if he's part-human or part-cyborg - since he's all-boring.never have i seen such a rapid fall from grace. why does hollywood make such bad sequels? on purpose? why; did the film-makers have a bet going?only one star for \"robocop 2\"; the fx are good but the story doesn't even try to match them. I just recently watched ed wood jr.'s autobiographical movie glen or glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years. nothing i had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what i saw. this has to be the most bizarre movie ever made. stampeding buffalo, women in bondage, satan prancing around and bela lugosi, rambling only as he can, \"bevare, bevare....pull the string, pull the string...\", it was totally insane. the acting was atrocious and the dialog was unintentionally hilarious, exactly what one would expect from an ed wood film. having said all that, as horrible as this movie was, i have to give wood credit...he was way ahead of his time. you have to remember that when this movie was made transvestites were not even discussed in public, much less the subject for a movie. i have read that wood was a transvestite in real life, and i'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. it was sad to see bela lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film, but it was kind of ed wood jr. to at least give mr. lugosi an acting job at a time in bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in hollywood would hire him. if you have never seen this film then you have to see it, especially if you are a fan of ed wood jr. This was an abysmal show. in short it was about this kid called doug who guilt-tripped a lot. seriously he could feel guilty over killing a fly then feeling guilty over feeling guilty for killing the fly and so forth. the animation was grating and unpleasant and the jokes cheap. it aired here in sweden as a part of the \"disney time\" show and i remember liking it some what but then i turned 13.i never got why some of the characters were green and purple too. what was up with that? truly a horrible show. appareantly it spawned a movie which i've never seen but i don't have any great expectations for that one either. It's dreadful rubbish. i liked 'how do you want me', 'father ted', 'green wing' and bill bailey's standup act but i file this with 'hippies' and 'planets of the apes' (the re-imagining) under 'great pedigree, went badly wrong'. my guess is that it appeals to the same people who like 'withnail and i'. it's overwritten but to little end, a luvvie-ish air pervades it and bernard black is simply a less camp withnail. and i thought it was self-indulgent even *before* dylan moran became the writer. but the set up raidiates such comic potential that for the first 2 episiodes i didn't even notice that it wasn't in the slightest bit chortle-worthy.the things they are saying/doing *should* be funny but somehow they don't manage to register as more than mildly amusing or \"i can see how someone writing this down might have thought that this would be funny\". what i am trying to say is that the situations/remarks are mildly humorous and yet too mundane/gentle/self-consciously surreal to be worth creating for and depicting in a sitcom. life is too short. avoid. What happened to mathew modine's career??? i can still recall when he was considered an a list actor...was it cutthroat island the final nail in the coffin of a once promising career??? wow, this guy must really hate renny harlin's guts...this movie wants badly to be a comedy but fails to deliver any laughs, the characters are caricatures, and badly drawn ones at that ... but still what pains me the most is seeing mr. modine taking up on this kind of roles, next to actors so far away from his caliber, i mean at the time when he was making movies like birdie he could never in his worst nightmares have imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a hick humping a cow that just had her anus stapled shut, and maybe whats even worst;next to elizabeth berkley!!!. The over-heated plot of \"bonjour tristesse\" is taken from a juvenile first novel by francoise sagan, which became a best-seller, though god knows why. for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. don't be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of jean seberg. she's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. the problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto preminger's st. joan -- seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. this movie, also by preminger, fulfills the \"promise\" of the first. it was her second movie; she was now 20. what was preminger thinking? that niven and kerr could compensate for seberg's lack of acting capacity? not a chance? seberg's character is at the center of the story and, pretty though she is, convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old, she can't meet the emotional demands of the role. i don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures. but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check. in spite of niven and kerr, this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons. First off, i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island. it says it was a 2006 movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldn't sleep i thought i would check it out. looked interesting. watched it, and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan pablo di pace and omg i could not believe it, this movie has been renamed three and will be a new movie?? it is playing again in 1 hr and 30 mins on showtime channel again and this date is may 28 and edt or florida time. you can check your showtime listings by title and see it. i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off, you see her naked body.... when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on. funny, there are a lot of other mess ups too. i can't believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie... go figure! wonder if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime, ha ha. good laugh. i give it 1-1/2 stars. c-, d+ movie. What happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm? homeless people answer to no one. they have no mortgages, rent payments or idiot bosses. homeless people don't have to worry about the irs or performance reviews or credit card payments. but, give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and, suddenly, they have to worry about entering the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance on their car, and working for someone else. they get a chance to be a \"productive citizens.\" this film was about as exploitive as a film can be. it's a way for the rich and middle-class sheeple to say \"see what happens when you try to help the poor?\" and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance.why not a film that asks, \"what happens when you take away everything a rich man has?\". This was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through. 30 minutes into the film and i couldn't take any more. seriously, do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo-arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured. boring, although the acting is fine; the kid is just plain irritating. some scenes are a little strange with very weird close-ups. i don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white, but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably. there was just nothing to watch, and although its a sad tale, supposedly, its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters. A perennial fixture in the imdb bottom 100, upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going!take the editing for a start; to call this choppy would be overly complimentary! indeed, had the makers of this got drunk one night and sliced and diced the film reels with some scissors and children's glue, then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have here. added to this, the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a torturous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly lacklustre climax. aside from the ever game michael sopkiw, poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual beastie that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly. yay verily, all in all this is a complete pile of crap if ever i've seen one.deary, deary me....and to think that lamberto bava directed this to....tut, tut indeed. note: this was released in the uk under the alternative title of devouring waves, although bereft of most of its gore scenes, which ironically are just about the only reason that this may have been worth watching. I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. having read the book several times (and all the other historical novels by mika waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. if i forget the origins of the story i might consider it a reasonably good epic. of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied, but it could be done with class. i can't understand why even the name of nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just nefer. i love peter ustinov as kaptah and marlon brando probably would have made a better sinuhe but the overall attitude is too hollywood to ever make justice to the book. mind you mika waltari left the premier of this film in the middle of the showing. that's how much he liked it. Put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big-budget debacle: a thrash-metal updating of \"dracula\", with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker (who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway) and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore. christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern-day--not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing; he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula's corpse, which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing's vault and flown to new orleans. this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century! the film, well-produced but without a single original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is both repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour starts repeating itself. * from ****. A box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. this is a very tedious film to watch. richard kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payoff. you are taken on a ride of slow build ups, one after the other with minor revelations at best. at certain moments, i thought to myself, this will have major significance at the end, but nothing does. the film just leaves one thinking, \"this story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the stretched out nonsense.\" i will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so. If the crew behind \"zombie chronicles\" ever read this, here's some advice guys: 1. in a \"twist ending\"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits. that tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? 2. i know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. joe haggerty, i'm looking at you...3. if you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.4. twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the \"reveal\" as soon as you introduce a character? that's not a great idea.kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, i'd rather they hadn't...only for zombie completists. As a dane i'm proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years. it's a terrible shame, however, that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism. in fact, it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies, and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters.i know it's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie, so let me stress that \"villa paranoia\" would be a terrible film under any circumstances. the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film. furthermore, waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money. erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings. i particularly enjoyed \"de frigjorte\" (1993). as an actor he is usually funny, though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies, namely that of a working-class slob who's down on his luck, partly because he's a slob but mostly because of society, and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community. this is problem number one in \"villa paranoia\"; clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer, which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible. it is much worse, however, that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on. for instance, the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near-death experience of the main character with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera work. after that, the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge. this is symptomatic of the whole movie; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is: telling instead of showing. thus, at one point, you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels, because the script wouldn't allow him to act out his feelings; and later on, voice-over is abruptly introduced, quite possibly as an afterthought, to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director's ineptitude. fortunately, at this point you're roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters, let alone the so-called story.the acting, which has frequently been a problem in clausen's movies, can be summed up in one sad statement: søren westerberg bentsen, whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother, is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast.i give this a 2-out-of-10 rating. I had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park. it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup. the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end. the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in \"on deadly ground\" as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder. i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage. the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear. what robert wagner, tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie. my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing. on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies. beware and be safe avoid at all costs. Wait... wait... wait... wait... wait... wait..... what!? this movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. the only reason kiefer sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to kiefer fans, only to have their hearts broken. he kills one guy, gets shot, and dies before half the movie is over, not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died...why put him on the cover if his character blows. 2. where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. it was way too confusing, i mean whats up with the girl? she had to narrate the movie to try to get our attention, she failed! 4. if kiefer dies in a movie..... it fails. now i am going to go watch 24..... this movie fails!. The plot of 'edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie. he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen, and should face the same fate as the entire f.r.a.t. squad. whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, justin timberlake managed to ruin it. do not waste your time watching this film. don't even bother downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice.and justin, if you're reading this, stick to music. even though you're no good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing. The worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast forwarded it to burt's bits and then the end!!! he is the only reason to watch this!! i have to admit to owning a copy as i am a huge burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie!! there are just no redeeming qualities about this movie!!! absolutely nothing what so ever to like about this movie!!! this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate burt's worst!! rob lowe's worst worst hour and a half of my life. I saw recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival and i can't believe that this is sweden's official submission to the 79th academy awards to be considered for best foreign film. producer anna anthony last year also had sweden's official submission for best foreign film with zozo. i wasn't personally a fan of zozo but at least it had some production value to it. this could have been shot as a high school film project. as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as it's characters. this is a story about five twenty something friends who live in a small swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long gone childhood. actually falkenberg isn't like some remote northern swedish village. it's a popular summer resort with a population of city and townships of almost 40,000 and lies between two major southern coastal swedish cities of götborg and malmo. the characters are likable enough guys but if they were high school age kids with a bleak or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives i would undoubtedly care about them more. they are however long past the point where they should be making plans to deal with adulthood. if they want to stay in falkenberg forever than certainly there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just riding bicycles, drinking, smoking pot and occasionally painting a house. maybe if they hung around with a girl or two in their circle of friends, of which girls are absent from this film altogether which doesn't make sense. jesper ganslandt makes his directorial debut and co wrote the film along with the cinematographer, of which i use the term loosely, fredrik wenzel. the acting isn't too bad. i would give this a 4.5 out of 10 but despite it's submission for consideration for the academy awards i would not recommend it. Navy seals is an ignorant, racist and complacent movie which thoughtlessly uses the middle east conflict as the backdrop for an action flick concocted for a comfortably sheltered american mid-west audience. the conflict, as well as those involved, is used simply as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young americans who proudly kill arabs for the good of 'freedom'. but what is worse is that the film's action scenes are sloppily handled and unexciting, which prevents navy seals from working even as a mindless shoot-'em-up.charlie sheen's character (hawkins) is disgusting, obnoxious, ignorant, reckless and, above all, racist. he refers to the middle east as a 's**t-hole' and to its inhabitants as 'rag-heads'. throughout the film, the navy seals' characters are glorified through the use of the lebanese natives as cannon fodder. they indiscriminately massacre these people with a consequence-free attitude. there is even the tasteless murder of a young lebanese boy who is shot by hawkins; hawkins makes fun of his language before shooting him whilst making another humorous quip. besides being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. the film's extreme (though predictable)pro-american stance is also revolting. this can be seen when the lebanese-american female journalist informs hawkins that terrorists cant be made to talk because 'they are religious zealots.' hawkins then retorts with 'yeah, and we are the navy seals!' the implication is obviously that zealots are meaningless next to american military might. moreover, even after insulting this journalist's racial heritage and treating her like a sex object, the script demands her inability to resist this disgusting thug and she still ends up sleeping with him - because he is an all-american navy seal. this marginalizes the journalist's character by making her submissive to the 'superior' pro-american attitude of hawkins despite his insulting behaviour toward her. beyond ethics, this plot twist also has little credence as drama. the screenplay is also amateurish. most scenes are simply strung together without any thought for mood, plot or character development. the 'music video' scene at the golf course, for example is just shoddily edited eye candy. and the two scenes where charlie sheen plays the reckless hero are also pointless. in one he jumps off a bridge from moving car just to show his mates how tough he is, and in the other he chases down a tow truck on a push bike and drives his car-off it. neither scene has a follow-up anti-climax, both are highly improbable, and neither has any bearing on the plot as a whole. they are just candy designed as a vehicle to showcase hawkins' cheap all-american heroics, and are poor substitutes for character development. most of the other plot development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly scripted as - in fact this affliction affects the entire movie. apart from the african american navy seal and his wife as well as the characters of michael biehn and charlie sheen, every other member of the team seems unknown to the audience, so that when the climatic scenes roll around there seems to nobody to root for and anybody's death to lament.in such a film, the action sequences can potentially rescue the production. but here they don't. these are badly directed, badly lit, and showcase badly performed stunts. in fact, their direction is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer, resulting in not only the scenes being incomprehensibly hard to follow, but also in a complete lack of fear and suspense. poor lighting only adds to their impotence. the explosions look fake, gunshot wounds unconvincing and one of the more daring stunts, involving crashing a mercedes over a tank, looks just like a stunt which has been staged on a backlot and then poorly edited.the ending of navy seals places the coins firmly on the eyes of this production. first there is the obligatory slow-motion 'running-away-from-the-big-explosion-that-should-have-killed-me' scene with sheen carrying biehn on his back. this was obviously the default scene intended to be the star of the movie's trailers. then there is the ending itself when the remaineder of the seal team, wounded and floating in the ocean, are rescued by a submarine. this submarine had in fact turned for home long before, but of course it had miraculously returned in the nick of time. topping it all of, despite the seals' violent and stressful ordeal, and despite the fact that numerous of their colleagues had just been killed, with a number of them still bleeding acutely, they all manage to laugh heartily while blessing america vociferously. predictable? you can just imagine this ending while watching the opening credits.this movie indulgently uses the middle eastern conflict as a vehicle for the macho all-american tendencies of the movies' photogenic young leads. arabs are treated condescendingly and dismissively, and their slaughter in the movie is used as a fulcrum to glorify the use of american military might against an 'inferior' minority group in a consequence-free environment. the events of 2001 have pointed out that such smug and overconfident trivialising of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence free passtime. the middle east can no longer be written off as a s**t-hole full of rag heads knocking each other off (to quote charlie sheen here); it is now a place in which involvement can lead to severe consequences. today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest themselves quite close to home. therefore, in the very least navy seals looks pretty foolish these days; but this is to be kind. this is a highly ignorant movie, whose production values and professionalism are equally suspect. navy seals is, ideologically and artistically, a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience. While studying the differences between religion and cult in college, mindy (rachel miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates cassandra (taryn manning), bailey (glenn dunk), alex (joel michaely) and morgan (victoria venegas) to research the massacre of worshipers of kwan yin by their leader owen quinlin (robert berson) twenty years ago in california. quinlin had found an ancient amulet in southern china that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls, but one woman resists and he is destroyed. however, after the death of morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that quinlin has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet.the storyline of 'cult\" is not totally bad. unfortunately, the screenplay, the direction, the acting, the lines, the camera, the cgi and the edition are awful. i was completely bored and tempted to use the ff button of the dvd, but i resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never-ending crap on a saturday night. my vote is two.title (brazil): \"o amuleto secreto\" (\"the secret charm\"). I was attracted to this movie when i looked at cast list, but after i watched it i must admit that i felt a bit disappointed. the main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. why? because of bad script. although dillon, lane and jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. so for matt dillon fans this is watchable movie, just like for admirers of beautiful diane lane. legendary tommy lee jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. so if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. the only thing that you'll remember about this flick is diane lane scenes; rest of it is very forgettable. This movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull, boring filmstrip that made me feel like i was back in mr. hartford's 8th grade social studies class -- way back in 67.what a waste, will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it.every time a scene had potential, all we were left with were a few clichés, combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action. shameful.ossie davis was the only bright light in this dull fest. the other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery.however, if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren't concerned with being awed or entertained, but want to learn about the uss mason, it is worth a watch. I have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life, i cannot believe that i wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =d this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. also the part where those \"men\" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film. how dare they say frank sinatra's name in vain? also, what is up with those glasses? when the guy and girl are in the car and she \"drinks\" water, you can totally tell that she isn't even drinking! also, what is up with the freaky dinner guy. and everyone knows that you don't stab tires, you slash them. This movie was very very mediocre and very very gory. everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot. not at all scary!. This is not a good film.i can usually sit through a van damme movie if i have to, as they are usually a bit of a laugh and don't require much thought. this one has no redeeming features. it has a distinct lack of plot, humour, acting, direction etc etc. a real stinker on all levels. i have never walked out of a cinema during a movie, although i came damme close here. avoid at all costs. ...but i've seen better too.the story here is predictable--a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred. three guesses what happens. this isn't a total bomb--the cast is fairly good with pros john ireland, faith domergue and john carradine giving the best performances. it's reasonably well-made--for a low budget film. just don't expect any nudity, swearing, blood or gore (the film has a very mild pg rating). i was never totally bored--it's ok viewing on a quiet night. i saw it on video--it was a horrible print--very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. still i didn't hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me--basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard. worth seeing but only if you're a horror film completest. Snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play-station, as you toss this into the waste disposal unit. spend a useful 90 min. living your favourite game. disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk. it takes a bits from several other \"science fiction\" movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story. there's nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game, but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film. any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally i would like my 90 min of life back. The 1980s tv show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language. \"the dukes of hazzard\" passed me by; it was not repeated whenever i was in front of the television in either new york or california; or, i probably would have watched. still, from somewhere (like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release), i knew it was about a fast, orange dodge charger - and, the \"general lee\" is still good to go. hunky cousins seann william scott and johnny knoxville (as bo and luke duke) are the new riders of the orange sage. beautiful jessica simpson (as daisy) fills her skimpy short well - but, even her arousing pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing, topless coeds. the too stupid plot involves a graying burt reynolds (as \"boss\" hogg) threatening to turn hazzard county into a strip-mine.** the dukes of hazzard (7/27/05) jay chandrasekhar ~ seann william scott, johnny knoxville, jessica simpson, burt reynolds. It was the tag-line \"in the tradition of american pie\" that fooled me into renting this movie. what i got was a piece of junk in the style of jackass, with the major difference that compared to this jackass the movie seems like a citizen kane.this movie made me regret that i rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10, because now i can't go beneath that. this one makes quite some bad movies look like cinematic feats.i actually turned it off after 45 minutes, and that's something i very rarely do. but it was just too plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary.can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10. what did your parents do? drop you on the head when you were just a child? or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you got nothing to compare it to? are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off? something must be wrong, at least.my advice: stay clear of this one. even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it for sure. When a movie's claim to fame is that martin sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. \"soultaker\" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. it's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.the plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be. joe estevez isn't much of an actor, so luckily for the audience, he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking. this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror/fantasy franchise, considering it has the same plot layout as a slasher. 4 characters, each dies one at a time...will any live? who really cares. though it sounds like i hated this, i didn't. i just didn't like it very well, but i was interested through most of it, so i guess that counts for something.my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. pg-13 for language, violence and nudity. This is the worst waste of time i've ever experienced. not even close to the first one. the story line difficult to follow - plot was weak - at best. the whole thing looked like three stories trying some way to tie them together and make a movie. it had a few good lines here and there - and the attempt at the message was admirable, but they went from houston through new york to get to dallas. it was really hard to tell over what period of time the present time took up. the movie was just over an hour and it felt like we had sat there watching the movie all afternoon. mayve points for being honest - but a son should not have to do all that kronk felt he had to do. do your self a favor - watch kuzco again. It's difficult to express how bad this movie is. even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the smug middle-class mores of both the usa and western europe, this movie would have been a stinker. the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if that's the correct latin grammar); the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics (by the male lead as well as the females); the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's (or somebody's) breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial; the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie -- i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic. the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot -- but underneath his clothes, this king has no substance. I've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back. thsi film isn't just poor its dire. it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made.i regret watching this film.flixmedia reckons its a race issue, apparently \"white\" people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors. mate, i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel.please stop making crap films. This documentary was neither professionally nor objectively made. the whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by ibm to win the match in question just to make some money. garry kasparov has an ego problem. he was puffed up before the match and when he lost, he didn't like it. i remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too difficult to win. as time went on, i started to lose and didn't like it. today, i simply don't play against computers anymore because they're just too good. not only that, the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games, where both sides are more likely to err and open the game to exciting possibilities. this documentary keeps showing us images of the turk which is an ancient chess playing automaton that was really controlled by a human being. from the start until the end we are lead to believe that ibm short of literally hid a human gm in the back of their cupboard-sized computer. i'm a computer scientist and take offense at the notion that just because garry lost, ibm must have cheated. i know how computers play chess. it's not magic and it's no mystery. they can be trained, have huge amounts of chess knowledge and they most certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. it's really no surprise that deep blue won. perhaps at the time it was. if it happened today, given the ever-increasing processing power of machines; people would hardly blink. if a machine couldn't at least draw with a gm today, people would think the program was weak. I'm not usually given to hyperbole, but after seeing over two decades worth of academy awards, i can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction, total cruelty, and sheer stupidity that i've ever had the misfortune to witness. i'm not talking about the awards themselves- as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be. what is terribly unfair is the treatment both the \"stars\" and \"non-stars\" received at the hands of cates and horvitz, in the name of \"reducing boredom.\"it is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who isn't al pacino has been \"played off\" at 45 seconds without any regard for what he was saying, how he was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. it demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they lose, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. all of those things were done to the \"non-stars\" -never mind that the movies wouldn't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience. the stars didn't fare much better. it's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliber of hilary swank and clint eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches. chris rock, as host, was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the academy had hoped, nor nearly as funny as he could be. his opening remarks were almost (but not quite) as offensive as sean penn made them out to be, and his comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting. of course, he could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has. in the end, chris rock was something he's almost never been before: a non-entity.even the musical numbers were handled poorly. beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs. another example of utter disrespect for an artist was giving jorge drexler's nominated song to antonio banderas- even though drexler was present and clearly wouldn't have minded singing his own song, based on his winning \"speech.\" the efforts of cates and horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree, but what resulted was a show devoid of life. we've all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know, about the overblown production, about the self-congratulatory quality. but this is their night- not ours. what is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated. cates and horvitz should, frankly, be ashamed. \"54\" is a film based on the infamous \"studio 54\" of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers. in the film, ryan phillippe is the main character, based on an actual employee of studio from 1977 - 1982.the film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance. it tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like \"boogie nights\" but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe. mike myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine-snorting club owner steve rubell. it's only a slightly comedic role and if this was myers' best attempts at sliding into drama like lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time, it's a total failure.\"54\" could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging. view at your own peril. The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. it gives the basic summary of what is going on. this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is all you will learn about them. the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. i have never played the video game, but know people who have. from my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better. save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters. Saw in on tv late last night. yeah, i can hear what y'all say about this one. it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo- typical tv soap series. in all fairness, the story line does have a fine twist to it, and you might nod saying, \"well, that's not what i expected.\" but, as a film, well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element. casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there's nothing to congratulate. rated r?? oh, that scene. did we need it? this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched. and what was the title again?. I caught this film -- under the title of \"what lies above\" -- on lifetime movie network last night, and just had to comment on it. designed as a resourceful-woman-in-peril, action adventure yarn, it is so unintentionally funny (thanks in large part to marc singer's scenery-chewing hammy performance)that i thought i was watching a cross between \"cliffhanger\" and \"home alone 5.\" heroine nicole eggert makes her devious but dumb as dirt male pursuers look like the three stooges succumbing to her ridiculous makeshift booby traps (somehow she manages to devise a swinging battering ram with rope and a log in a matter of minutes, which temporarily takes out one of the knuckleheads who want to kill her). worth watching for a hearty laugh. Unlike many, i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive. its execution, however, is another matter entirely. like so many b-minus movies, all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers. for most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor. or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers. with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful; the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a canadian one.) notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle, i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas. unfortunately, they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies. the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town (why? are they so hard to find in saskatchewan?) did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors? as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by the cbc's publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom. I'm sorry but i just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this. it's stereotypical and real homeschoolers are nothing like they were on this show!! personally i'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes. i mean, this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. if anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then i honestly feel sorry for them. this reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of homeschooled kids in \"mean girls\". it's sad, really, that people think this way. this is complete garbage, imho. After completing the lackluster novel, heart of darkness, i moved on to watch the movie, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. at the onset, i expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book. however, even though i had read the novel, the movie still made no sense at all, so i can't imagine how lost i would be if i had skipped the book altogether. it seemed as though the writers picked out their favorite parts and put them in the movie, and left out anything that may assist the viewers in comprehending the meaningless plot. this dreadful movie made no sense at all, and i would strongly recommend against watching it, as it will do nothing more than leave you completely baffled and bewildered. The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle. too bad the producers and writer/director, michael cimino, spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the johnson county war was really about. a lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. the cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. the entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.the worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. the peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of indians would do in much earlier hollywood movies. the true fact is that johnson county sheriff william (red) angus, with a posse of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the ta ranch. i doubt any women took part in the siege. ellen (ella also known as cattle kate) watson and her second husband, james averell, were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the johnson county invasion. ella was never a prostitute. this was a canard spread by the wyoming stock growers association (wsga) in order to discredit her. the fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the wsga.i object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. there is no fact in the events, time lines, or backgrounds of the characters. why michael cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the johnson county war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.the movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the federal government intervention in a state government's affairs and what happened after the wsga gunmen were saved by the calvary. some effort was made to prosecute the cattlemen who were responsible by the johnson county attorney. but since johnson county could not afford the court costs and the governor of wyoming, amos w. barber, backed the wsga, the charges were eventually dropped.overall i think the movie was just an excuse to show isabelle huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of running time on the dvd version. David lynch's crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families. the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth-hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises, the son and mother are permanently horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series.lynch is not famous for his comedies (i.e. on the air, aspects of wild at heart), and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general. however, there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud. there are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in dumbland).i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward, if disturbing, animated comedy here. interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-brow humor (i.e. most will farrell films) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross-out humor. while the blend doesn't really work very well here, it is nothing if not lynchian.worth seeing by lynch fans. I spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80's and 90's. this was, by far, the worst film i ever showed to the public. one thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great, inspiring film. even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre. jamie lee curtis, in an early non-horror film role, demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act (she's still trying, but it isn't getting much better).i'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball! even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck.this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv. it is not worth the price of a movie rental; your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked (because it can only be better than this). This film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core. the settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure. the lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue. tom hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as bruce willis did in hart's war. tom, you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank! the content did not warrant the histrionic acting by paul newman. this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing. Granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema.the script was diabolical, so bad in fact that i was almost crying with laughter at some of the things they came out with. the acting was almost as bad, they would have been better off casting traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). the murders were laughable, the suspense was non existent, the camera work was ineffective and the \"major\" plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, it just gets worse and worse.\"the granny\" is possibly one of the most unthreatening \"villains\" caught on film, she looks like she is wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket (the nylon hair caused endless amounts of laughter) and a frilly nightgown. would you be scared by that??? i certainly wasn't.if you like watching bad movies (see manos, troll 2, michael bay films &#61514; ) then this is a must see. those who don't like bad movies and don't enjoy laughing at shockingly bad dialogue, avoid like the plague. All i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. this is city of god meets happy days. the bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. you can approach it in one of two ways: (1) a gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, abc-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. either way it just don't fly, do it? why then has it received so much praise? as others have implied, it gets the \"conscience vote\" from the west. show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy, double-wide theatre seats and 44-oz cokes, and we'll applaud in a heartbeat. but--oh--don't forget to candy coat it, because the bitter pill of reality (tantalizing as it is) is hard for us to swallow.i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there. all i can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (hollywood oscars = sweeping, syrupy tripe. cannes film festival = beard-stroking, artless propaganda). to find the real gems, you'll have to work hard at it. How offensive! those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible. i can imagine those at nbc saying, \"ok. let's make a movie to appease those pesky christians, but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order.\" well, they were wrong. anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. i only gave this movie a 1 because i couldn't give it a 0. I have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield. indeed, from me he gets \"no respect.\" i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it, and found exactly what i expected: a stupid story without any real humour. it's full of lame, crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer's (dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in utah that just didn't capture my attention at all.in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast, including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner (i didn't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for this.)this truly is a dangerfield disaster.2/10. First, let's all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. however, in this piece of @*!^ called snakeeater, the film industry as a whole sank.first, let's start with the plot. a vietnam vet named jack kelly, aka soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with.now, the acting. being an actor myself, i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art!!!!! lamas is, well, himself. the jackasses playing the clampets/deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break!finally, the action. the gunfighting is so-so at best, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. i've seen more real-looking fights at the renaissance festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!readers, listen to me: avoid this piece of caca at all costs! if it were the only film in existence, you still would want to avoid it! for the sake of your brain-cell count, do not watch this thing!. Who's responsible for these \"behind the scenes\" things? who are these actors? did they crawl out from beneath rocks? 'yuks, lots of yuks!' no. no yuks for me. only loathing and shame that i am a human being. i have to avert my eyes from the set, it's so embarrassing. in fact, i changed the channel.i've always had a problem with robin williams' non-stop 'i forgot my lithium today' rantings, but at least he's funny once in a blue moon. watching someone who isn't funny at all impersonating robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity.please stop making these absolutely horrifying tv movies. please. This is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, silly, pointless piece of trash i've ever seen, an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. if you think that ed wood's \"plan 9\" is bad, well... let me tell you, looks like \"citizen kane\" compared to that one. ¿special effects?...again, \"plan 9\" is \"star wars\". ¿acting?...thor johnson is al pacino... so it's beyond bad, really. but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies, it's for you! i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies, the price-corman-poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with \"star creatures\" they descend right down to the z level. of course, my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an indian chief is great) so have fun and enjoy... if you can. My brother is an avid dvd collector. he took one look at the cover (two models on toilets) and had to add it to his collection. i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie (i use that term loosely) i've felt obligated to sit through. i dared not make eye contact with my brother, quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist. the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene, which the \"filmmaker\" decided to show every take of (about four total) throughout the movie. in fact, the whole movie pretty much follows this suit. the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock. (i went to bed without viewing it, however). to no surprise at all, i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later. Ok we have 4 city electricians who find a mini nuke reactor, turn it in and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen also from a parallel universe, who managed to slip through with a few of her kin to take over the earth, but alas she is the only one left? if so why did not the rest of humanity join up and hunt her down. also what happened to the military, no way a few billion plus round of ammo could have been used up and why hide out in a basement when a lot more defensible places had to available. also not a dig on city workers, but how is it they knew what a mini nuke reactor looked like and how if they did not have one in the parallel universe, could they reopen the rift? sorry but there was nothing likable about the movie. How they got al pacino to play in this movie is beyond me. this movie is absolutely terrible. i discovered, after reading some of the other reviews, that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film, which deeply puzzles me, because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution. it's not just that it's a bad movie, with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant, but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded (which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does, though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards) or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible. for example, we see donald sutherland running around with a huge, fat ugly mole on his face. he does not normally have a mole. the mole does not add to his character. it is extremely ugly and distracting. it's not like robert de niro's mole; it's much worse. why the hell has he got that mole? it's as if the filmmakers just said, \"let's see, how could we make this movie even worse than it already is? i know, let's give mr. sutherland a giant, ugly-ass mole right on his face.\"another example of the filmmakers' stupidity is the character ned. we see, for the first three-quarters of the movie, young ned. at one point, \"six months later\" appears on the screen. we see ned again, and it is, of course, the same actor playing the boy. five minutes later, \"three weeks later\" appears on the screen, and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older ned. what, do they think we're idiots? good god! again, it's like the filmmakers are saying, \"how can we possibly make it any worse? i don't think we can...oh wait! i just had a terrible idea!\" i know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year, which is fine, but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks. just don't get another actor to play ned, or at least get him to play the five minutes when he's three weeks younger. furthermore, the kid who plays the \"older\" ned does not look any older than \"young\" ned. as a matter of fact, he just looks completely different, much skinnier, and no taller or older than the original actor, which is very confusing, as i, like any rational human being, thought at first that it was a new and different character.what, did the first kid die while they were filming the movie? because he was in it for the first hour and a half, and then all of a sudden, three weeks later, the guy from lock stock and two smoking barrels is playing ned for the last five minutes of the movie. and even if the original actor did die, the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role, and re-shoot the measly five minutes of \"six months later\" scenes. better yet, just scrap the movie completely, never finish it and never release, never even tell anybody about it, because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time.i'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it; it's so bad that you should watch it, just to see how badly it sucks. it's terrible, terrible. Carrie fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem, and she doesn't remember very much of it. that would explain why she made this film, but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did; i can't believe that everybody had a coke problem. this has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made, and that's saying something. the blame can't be laid at the feet of \"director\" tim kincaid or \"writer\" buddy giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone. apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. what is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop. co-star robert joy has done good work in other films, and composer jimmie haskell and cinematographer arthur marks are both industry veterans, marks also having been a director, and not a bad one. why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension. tim kincaid, the alleged \"director\", has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, i can tell you that not a one of them is any good. this one, though, is by far the worst thing he's ever done, and that is a major accomplishment on his part. everything, absolutely everything, about this movie is 12th-rate--at best. the cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the \"special effects\" make \"plan 9 from outer space\" look like \"spider-man\", the story is trite, derivative and stupid. don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover, let alone renting it. a complete, utter, annoying, total dud. Of all of the post-1985 perry mason movies i have seen, this one is my least favorite.i confess i have never liked diana muldaur as an actress. she only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard-bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with. this one is no exception - it runs true to form.the only thing that saves this movie, in my opinion, is an earnest performance by scott baio as the prosecutor - i actually found myself rooting for him to win, and the movie is worth seeing for him alone. For some reason, various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first. james (gregory lee kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of \"tyranus\" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead \"demonicus\" back to life. this shot-on-digital full moon release is stupid, senseless, has terrible acting and sound and the (los) angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy. however, it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance. whether bug-eyed running around in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection, kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed. oh well, at least he's not boring like most of the rest of the cast. Prison is set in wyoming where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to re-open an old state penitentiary that has been closed for 20 years, warden eaton sharpe (lane smith) is put in charge. 200 odd prisoners are shipped in & they are put to work fixing the rundown prison up including burke (viggo mortensen) who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber, he duly obliges but when he penetrates the bricked up door an intense beam of light shoots out & all the electrics, gas & fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes. burke has unwittingly unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing & no-one is safe...directed by renny harlin i thought prison was a poor late 80's horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story. the script was by empire pictures regular c. courtney joyner who was responsible for writing such 'classics' as class of 1999 (1990), puppet master iii: toulon's revenge (1991) & puppet master vs. demonic toys (2004) amongst other low budget horror crap that even i haven't heard of & seems to take itself very seriously. the biggest problems i have with prison are that it's far too slow, it's over 30 minutes into the film before the 'evil force' is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as i was concerned, then there's the fact there's no discernible storyline here at all. for a start it never tries to explain why there's an 'evil force' bricked up in the old execution chamber, it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when it's supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just doesn't kill warden sharpe straight away, no explanation is given to where burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was electrocuted & has come back, there's no real explanation as to how the warden is connected to everything that's going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although it's never revealed what it is or why. to be honest i couldn't really give you a plot synopsis as the film doesn't have a rigid story which it follows all the way through. the character's are dull & forgettable, the murders are few & far between, the pacing is way off, the whole film is a mess & even ghosts can't shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero. a less than satisfactory way to spend 100 odd minutes, there really are better things you could be doing.director harlin's full american flick debut he does a good job & there's a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab, dull, dark prison cells & corridors i started to get bored. i just think the look of the film is far too repetitive, bland & frankly lifeless. i didn't think it was scary & the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of barb wire wraps itself around his body & face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open. other than that there's a burnt corpse & a mangled body which falls from the ceiling & very little else. there is a scene when the warden burns all the prisoner mattresses in front of them & then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard, i was watching this scene & thought that you'd never get away with doing something like that. over here prisoners have rights & if the warden did something like that there would be a national outcry from all those humanitarians & every prisoner would sue the warden, the prison service & the government for everything they had & they'd win!with a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it doesn't really look like it on screen, sure there's a decent cast & the few special effects that are included are good but overall it's set in the same location with limited ambition. prison was actually shot in a real wyoming state prison so it certainly looks the business. the acting is alright, prison proves that sometimes hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film skeleton in their closets but in the case of mortensen he has two with this & the awful the return of the texas chainsaw massacre (1994) both of which i'm sure he'd like to forget about...prison is a dull, lifeless, colourless & humourless waste of 100 minutes, despite one good gore scene i didn't like it at all as i actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events & incidents cobbled together with no narrative sense. I thought maybe... maybe this could be good. an early appearance by the re-animator (jeffery combs); many homage's to old horror movies; the troma label on the front this movie could be a gem! i thought wrong.frightmare is a boring, overplayed, half assed homage to the fright films of yore. the story is an old one, young people breaking into a house, getting drunk, making love, and tampering with things that shouldn't be tampered with. the oft  recycled slasher film formula is used here, this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad radzoff doing the killing. in fact, the performance by the radzoff's actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. he does the snooty dracula style character very well. but as for the kids, its not so good, with combs only having a minimal part.the film lacks entertainment value, and only features one cool character, and one or two scenes that can hold your attention. i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch, and this is the only movie left at blockbuster. The memory keeper's daughter in the form of a novel by kim edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. so what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie? perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by john pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by mick jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation. perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the 'liquid tears' musical score by daniel licht. for whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with down syndrome. and for that it is worthy of attention. dr. david henry (dermot mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful norah (gretchen mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy. on a stormy winter night in kentucky norah goes into labor and the henry's rush to a nearby clinic where david delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of his old friend, nurse caroline gill (emily watson). after the delivery of a perfect boy child (paul) norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly...) delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl. david and caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term down syndrome) and david, having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: caroline is to make the delivery and norah is told the second twin died at birth. caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child. aided by a friendly trucker, caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's pittsburgh. norah insists on a formal funeral for phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs david's psyche, and the henry's life goes on with only the one child paul, leaving submerged pains about the lack of phoebe's presence. norah gifts david with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and david becomes obsessed with photography. norah grieves, drinks, and loses david's attention, while david traces phoebe's existence with caroline - sending money and letters to pittsburgh. paul (tyler stentiford to jamie spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to juilliard he goes. meanwhile phoebe (krystal hope nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of phoebe's and paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported caroline gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. the cast of well-known actors tries hard, but only emily watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script. jamie spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise. dermot mulroney and gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver. the film is a mess, but the message about acceptance of down syndrome children and adults is an important one. grady harp. This is an atrocious movie. two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man. there's not much to give away in regards to a plot or a \"spoiler\". i would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick. much of the film involves locke and camp cackling obnoxiously, all the while grinning psychotically at the camera. add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again, including a vaudevillian song about \"dear old dad\" that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees. the music is annoying at first, then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen. the theme here is of youth run amok, understandable as a reaction to the '60s, but done with little imagination or style. avoid it!. This, for lack of a better term, movie is lousy. where do i start......cinemaphotography - this was, perhaps, the worst i've seen this year. it looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man. maybe they only had one camera. it gives you the sensation of being a volleyball.there are a bunch of scenes, haphazardly, thrown in with no continuity at all. when they did the 'split screen', it was absurd. everything was squished flat, it looked ridiculous.the color tones were way off. these people need to learn how to balance a camera. this 'movie' is poorly made, and poorly done.the plot - you got to be kidding. if i was an ss agent, i'd sue the producers. looked like the marks brothers with radios and guns. sutherland was in his '24' mode - i can see this for free. eva longoria would have been better with a little less on, and a lot more showing. as an action bimbo she wasn't much.i couldn't see a real plot, other than douglas boinking the presidents wife. never did say why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres. i just don't see the president of the united states running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-e.hollywood is dead. this movie is the proof. i like 'the big screen'. have since i was a kid. many more 'movies' like this and i'll quit going. whats the matter hollywood, made so many chick flicks, forget how to make a real movie? if i owned a theater, i'd start running the old movies. the one with real actors, good story lines - and good cinemaphotography.this 'movie' is a dog. don't waste your time or money on it. i rate this 'movie' a zero! douglas isn't suited for this role. i can over look his age, but his just is to much of a wimp to carry this off. Here is another great film critics will love. the problem is that it is not a very good movie.the films premise is simple. nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.the first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.the two halves simply don't mix. individual scenes do work very well (the guys crashing a friends house who has a new filipino bride is hilarious while a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings.) they simply don't mesh with each other.the movie as well is missing entire set-ups. one scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. the very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. where did they get the dresses and wigs? (the crew includes both the big guy and a midget) how did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? and most puzzling is why are they in drag? they are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? i mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (in fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) the movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch. as we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film. it is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.9 souls is a big disappointment, the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself. This film was sourced from my friends mum who worked in a charity shop. she gave it to us along with a load of other unknown cassette tapes. the film itself is a bit rubbish. there are a few notable bits to laugh at like the bit when his girlfriend gets her head drilled into, but in general the film is bland. interstingly when i saw the trailer for \"the island\" i couldn't help noticing the similarities. clonus may have been the inspiration for that film? all in all don't bother watching this film as it is dull and boring. we enjoyed it so much when we were 16 that we named our band after it. another sign this film is a bit crappy is the shots on the back of the video case don't actually appear in the film? weird. I wasn't as \"lucky\" as some of the others commenting on this film: i have never seen anything else out of the...shall we say... \"fecund\" mind of sarno. i agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dancing are not really that attractive. i kinda liked fraulein crank(?)...she was so homely , she was cute! the acting was pretty stale, also, though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem. trying to follow the plot was a major chore: was there one, really? i do heartily agree with one other comment: for a vampire movie, there's not much blood. yep, if you want good bloodsucking flicks, check out such hammer classics as \"horror of dracula\" and (my personal favourite) \"brides of dracula\".the most (unintentionally) humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats...which you never see!...the bats, i mean.okay as a time-waster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the great white north but, for heaven's sake, don't rent it!. I actually liked certain things about this game. i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. there's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. the graphics really weren't bad, but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. the music was fine. the things i hated were: the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality. the inability to save was awful!!! some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. i thought the weapons kind of sucked, too. this game is fun for awhile, but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. i'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. play it at your own risk. I have anticipated the various sci-fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film. while some people walked out of the film, i decided to stay, only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting, lack of suspense, ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line. i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film. the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack. this is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing. in retrospect, i wouldn't even rent this one, let alone pay more than $5 to see. Lord protector is kiddie fare, but for whose kids? obviously shot for television or stv, this amateurish rehash krull has several stock characters -- a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist -- on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the dark forces about to be unleashed on their planet. badly written, acted and staged in available california locations like municipal parks and a ranch, lord protector has nothing to recommend it, not even as a time waster. jay underwood is the only \"name\" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five year olds, are not likely to remember him from such ancient disney fare as not quite human. a no-name actor playing a magician in an ill-fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of king lear. i was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence. alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted-over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks, like bert gordon's the magic sword. the filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be. often, such cheap hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. i kept myself occupied during the film's seemingly interminable running time, trying to figure which was which in this one. i didn't have much luck. Entrails of a virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. if this was an intentional characteristic of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance-but of course it isn't. without getting too much into plot summary, let's take a quick walking tour of the events. at a secluded cabin, an orgy is in progress, which includes topless wrestling and diaper p***ing. a vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress, but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster i like to call \"the muddy ninja.\" this monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one, except the proverbial virgin (if you don't count oral sex) who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone's severed hand. finally she has her guts pulled out, and then there's a scene which seems to imply that she's pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. got all that? if you're going to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak japanese and don't have any subtitles. in a season populated by boring hollywood flicks, putting this in your vcr might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. it will certainly be something different. How irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me. overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie. terrible script, with forced character quirks (the brown sauce). romanticising all that is bad about dublin. the attitude of 'ah, it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same'. plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences (the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase). and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney's character. a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old. cringeworthy stuff. the best thing about this movie is farrell, and it's a bad when you have to say that. well, at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent. international audiences be warned: stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock. you'll have a better time. intermission is a walk-outer. The movie opens with beautiful landscape shots of the northwest countryside. fenceposts jutting out from soddy earth, a freight train crossing fields of hay in the distance, billows of clouds, small structures by the side of the road, a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere. over this plays a languid but mysterious twin peaks piano arrangement and it's all adequately moody and atmospheric in an american gothic sort of way. through this however director jon jost keeps interleaving awkward frames, blocks of letters, opening credits with annoying swooshing sounds, color frames that announce \"blue\", numbers that count towards the \"12 steps to a conclusion\" announced in the opening credits. it's obvious by the first couple of minutes that, though jost is more than capable to capture landscape and ambiance, he doesn't care for it. he has neither the affection for pacific northwest open expanses that terrence malick does in badlands and neither the time or inclination of twin peaks david lynch to weave mystery and intrigue around a given location.the rest of the movie is more jon jost frustration with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose. the use of split screen is interesting, i like in particular how we get the first image of ricky lee split in two, one is recounting childhood memories that matter only to him, the other is cursing and banging his head against the wall, and over the course of the movie the second ricky lee prevails, the macho laid-back hipster with the shades who is hopelessly self-involved and stupid. on the other hand the stop motion animation and choice to play most of the movie in voice-over narration does not work. it does at times because jost writes as good as he shoots static shots of the smalltown american nowheresville but beth ann's monologues, delivered in the most flat nasal monotone imaginable, a voice that sounds like stephen hawking's computer speech program crossed with a horse whinnying, are so grating to the ear it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to pay attention.each of the couple relate to us their past experiences, their small triumphs and follies and doubts and past relationships that went nowhere. they say very little to each other and what they say they say with blank faces. but they hump like rabbits. that seems to be their only channel of communication left open, perhaps the only one they can trust with any safety. jost clearly picks his main characters in frameup among the naive and delusional, those baited by an american dream turned sour, but he doesn't place himself above them. he's not condescending or smug in his portrayal. they may be misguided but they are graced with moments of humanity, awkward though they may be. we're called to empathize and show affection rather than point and laugh. this is the most successful frameup becomes; the movie's characters come alive even when their expressionless faces do not, even when jost gets in their way with his stilted framing and obtrusive camera games.then we go back to angry rants about the destructive effects of money played over an inserted shot of a dollar bill, we get a weird psychedelic sequence where jost's camera glides under big leafy trees that soon turn beetroot red as beth ann repeatedly muses about the \"redwood trees\" in the voice-over, we even get a sudden about-turn towards plot and genre as the couple of beth ann and ricky lee, smalltown losers with nowhere to go and nothing to hold them back to their dead end lives, arrive in california and decide to rob a 7/11. the movie doesn't soar to an emotional crescendo in the aftermath of the botched 7/11 job such as one might expect from a 'couple-on-the-run' road movie, it slowly screeches to a halt and you look out the window to see it hasn't really got anyplace in particular. parts of the ride have been hypnotic and parts almost touching and funny, but everything else has been mostly annoying. Sorry my fellow nevada city neighbors, but this one is bad.brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie.alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside. she was stiff throughout the movie.i looked up both alice and brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work. i would have guessed that they were first-year students.ed asner and peter jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line. ed certainly has not lost his charisma. i wish i'd taken the time to meet him while he was here.i love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because i've been there. i make nevada city my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere. i was sadly disappointed.sorry. Quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time. the plot was full of irrelevance, and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long time.to make it worse, camera angles that made me feel sick were used , the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue (maybe not a bad thing then), and the shots of san francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist board's promotional video.oh, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done. better lighting next time, please. I just saw this at the 2006 vancouver international film festival. the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out. i'm sorry to say i was very disappointed.besides being poorly written, it was boring. i won't take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script.first bite was cliché without being ironic, over the top seriousness without being funny. the movie would have been better had hunt hoe went with a campy horror feel. instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film. i can't recommend this film. it felt too long and all in all just plain weak. Can they possibly get any worse than this? probably. but after all steven seagal gets to do what he does. well kind of; this time instead of mortally wounding the bad guys he just wounds them. by reputation of being a bad ass agent seagal is hired to deliver a special package from france to america. but it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and foul up the mission. the fights just don't have enough bite and the big bangs are just big and that's all. anna-louis plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear wooden. also in the cast are: jeffery pierce, max ryan and harry van gorkum. don't put all the blame on seagal for this clunker. When a bbc murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the killer must be: the homosexual.who murdered the sexy blonde teenager (who's also a pathological liar) on her way home from school? let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) is letting her teenaged son make unchaperoned visits to his serial-killer father behind bars? could it be the moody son, who's impressed by his dad's no-nonsense attitude about women? could it be the serial killer himself, who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars, a la hannibal lecter? could it be mom's boyfriend, a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex-student led to his wife's suicide? or could it be boyfriend's daughter, who goes blabbing everyone's secrets at school, causing untold misery? no, it's none of these likely suspects. it's...the homosexual!the only mystery for the viewer is guessing who the homosexual is. of course, it could be anybody, since the only characteristics of the homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the \"normal\" folks. the homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's ills; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together, and things can return to normal...whatever that is.as for the cast, both jemma redgrave and robson green are now officially past their sell-by dates. the world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again, but as long as the bbc has roles for the aggrieved woman and the misunderstood man, i suppose they'll keep coming back in movies like this one. So i got this from the rental store where i work before it was released (release is 8/21), just watched it today, and now i'm speechless. they could have had a decent movie here, but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways.first of all, the parts with john krasinski were funny, and are the only reason i gave it above a 3, but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible \"serious\" reflections on life between the main character (andrew keegan) and his girlfriend (the annoying lacy chabert). it would have been much, much better as a straight comedy ala lock, stock and two smoking barrels.i wanted to like it, because i think krasinski is funny and want to see him do well. the story wasn't bad either, just not very original. but the directing (and a lot of the acting) was terrible. i swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway.their carelessness is showcased when the gun expert corrects another character and says that a \"dirty harry\" gun is not a .357 magnum but a .45 (it was, as everyone knows, a .44 magnum).so see this if you 1- really like john krasinski 2- like to watch low-budget (and poorly-directed) movies or 3- have too much time on your hands (this is me!). This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. there's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the baby cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. at times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the \"cub,\" who nearly gets lost early on. all in all, disappointment.that said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him. Arnold fans will holler in joy, fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment, and catholics will just holler.illogically written by andrew w. marlowe and ham-handedly directed by peter hyams, *end of days* gets the terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown (arnold schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation), whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine about.it is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn. even as the technological stank of y2k muttons the new york streets, ex-cop turned alcoholic security guard, jericho cane (schwarzenegger, with the perfunctory \"dead-wife-and-kid\" back-story for loose cannon effect), must brave theological waters to save 20-year-old virgin christine (robin tunney) from being conscripted as  wait for it  the bride of satan. dun dah daaaarrrh! stupidity ensues.for every anti-hero, there is his anti-christ. gabriel byrne is the devil here  and he's out to party like it's 1999, on a mission to impregnate christine with the anti-christ between 11 pm and 12 midnight, december 31, 1999  ironically, in the hour that all porn will be lost  thereby bringing about the end of days. being able to read minds, conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic, it doesn't occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time; instead, he appears on december 28th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesn't welcome him with open thighs (see above comment re: stupidity.) here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered, let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology. a priest (rod steiger) tells jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with a '1' in front of it. so wait - *prince* is the anti-christ?satan soze pursues jericho and christine (j and c  get it?) around town, at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture. in one scene, satan recreates jericho's wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine. but if he can see so deeply into jericho's mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia, why can't he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago? satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue, yet he can't make that assassin unjam a semi-automatic weapon. and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range, satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing, so jericho won't worry unduly about satan's health - not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds matter of fact, instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her, satan expends so much unnecessary energy on side-projects (crucifying the tongue-less guy, blowing up jericho's partner (kevin pollak) and then saving him, and then blowing him up again, ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought) that we wonder whether a more efficient assassin/lover shouldn't be put on the case  say, antonio banderas.what i find most precious about *end of days* is arnold's valiant attempts at the method: \"sad\" means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; \"depressed\" means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; \"deathly scared\" means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent. there's definitely a pattern here, if we could only decipher it.in the end, the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these, but from the atheist jericho. while the timid men of an impotent god exhort \"faith\" and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them, the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent. which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear: that even if the devil were to exist, those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall, let alone act towards it. further, they might not truly want him defeated, for only through his contrary polarity does their god's existence become tenable.for it is written in the book of revelations: \"and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan, and impregnate a virgin on a date which won't have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia, by which time, christians will have forgotten christ's actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead. and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguously-lesbian band members\" i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified, and the alcoholic built like a mr. universe; i can believe that a giant, supernatural monster can't kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent; i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay - but what i cannot believe is the 20-year-old virgin in new york city in 1999.especially around prince... Hi, everyone, oh, boy... this one is a lulu. it has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. there are three bad guys who, i guess, are the stars of this. they beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. usual stuff.the woman who is sending them on their missions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. it's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. she walks like she is balancing an egg on her head.the wardrobe is 70s leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. the bad novocain mouth woman wears red. a silk frock perhaps, or maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big.i actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. it lets us in on what happened earlier in the film.the police officers are ok. some bad, some good, all stupid except two. the two bright ones could have worked again in hollywood.the movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. the middle sucks. the guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. he is like a 1940s character actor. great voice.this one is a bit too long. the lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. it would have been easier to understand a bird.her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker.tom willett. I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night. well, there's not one ounce of \"cool\" in this ridiculous movie. the score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than \"boy meets girl,\" the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes. the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly-busy organ music. this joey de francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is helping with movie scores). is it possible to not only get my four dollars back, but have my therapy sessions paid for as well? this movie, interestingly enough, is so bad, you might want to watch it. sort of like driving by a bad accident -- you just have to look at least once. just get the ear plugs ready!. Cowardly and cynical, `the hospital' represents the nadir of paddy chayefsky's special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire.thanks to ham-handed director arthur hiller, this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly, poorly paced presentation it deserves.only a great performance by george c. scott, in the sort of mean-spirited role he was born to play, keeps `the hospital' from being a complete disaster.ironically, though, scott's performance does viewers a disservice. his magnetism keeps them watching when they might more profitably turn off the vcr and clean out the closets, stare at the clouds, or watch re-runs of `baywatch.'certainly, anyone who emotionally invests in the set-up _ modern medicine apparently gone amok _ will feel cheated by the dismal payoff, where chayefsky reveals that the system works just fine, so quit your carping.while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy, it all turns out to be a red herring. before that becomes clear, though, chayefsky gives some good lines to scott as his middle-aged, middle-class, white male stand-in.bitter, alcoholic, impotent, scott's dr. herbert bock has alienated those who know him best, and he has the bile to keep alienating them. in chayefsky's worldview, all that of course makes bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his age.playing a collection of adjectives, the long-haired, long-legged, braless and almost bust-less diana rigg struggles in the part of `the girl.' the british rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress would struggle as well. like the rest of a good cast gone to waste, rigg can't overcome a script that isn't interested in any character except bock, or any philosophy beyond banality.for fans of george c. scott, this is another star turn and worth watching. for fans of black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. for anyone else, don't bother. \"little man\", now on dvd, is a wayans brothers flop. it's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist. he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home. he then goes through all sorts of \"home alone\" or \"child's play\" like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film. the jokes have been done in other places so many times, that they aren't cute or funny. i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use cgi and used the small actor who marlon's face was pasted over. in watching the deleted scenes (minus cgi) this actor was funny in a mini-me like way, but they chose a different route. a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenes..spend your rental fee $ on borat if you want some real laughs these days.http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com. The 1963 version of \"the haunting\" has been one of my favorite horror films for years, so i anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of trepidation. it hardly seemed that any follow-up could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece. unfortunately my worries were well-founded: this movie stinks.i don't know what the people involved in this film were thinking. jan de bont, who seemed to have had a fluke when he directed the excellent \"speed,\" does as poorly here (or perhaps even worse) as he did with the much-hyped duds \"twister\" and \"speed 2: cruise control.\" hey jan, stick to cinematography, would ya? liam neeson is adequate in his role as the doctor-pretending-to-be-a-sleep-psychologist -- i don't think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance -- but even he cannot save a lame script and weak story. catherine zeta jones proves once again (as she did in \"entrapment\") that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her. the female lead, who did great in an episode of \"the x-files,\" looks lost here as eleanor, an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity. and that blond guy, whoever he is, is more wooden than the laughably strange statuettes of children carved into the woodwork around the house. i don't think he changes expression once during the entire film.(spoilers ahead)the reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of eleanor's precarious mental state. no spirits are actually seen in the original, leaving much up to the imagination--a hallmark of other great horror films like \"the changeling\" and \"the blair witch project.\" in this updated version, we of course get tons of cgi ghosts, which basically (in the face of the weak script/plot) make the movie totally unscary. the f/x aren't even that great, considering they were done by ilm. the frozen breath looks particularly fake. the effects in the underrated peter jackson film \"the frighteners,\" which i saw just before this one, were a lot better. the wooden carvings of the children, which are supposed to look creepy, just look silly (especially when they scream), and the cgi monsters are nothing to write home about. rather than providing a relief from the bad acting, bad direction, and bad writing, the effects only add to this mess of a film.some particularly dumb scenes: when the three other characters break into eleanor's bedroom, and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge scowling demon hovering over the bed. the scene where eleanor \"sees\" the former lady of the house hanging from the rafters... the acting here is particularly bad. and last, but not least, the unintentionally hilarious bit where wooden blond guy utters an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish, leaps up on a piece of furniture, and starts slashing away at the painting of the old, evil guy who built the house. we actually get some satisfaction in this scene, as seconds after his attack, blond guy is dragged over to the fireplace by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the flue. it was the only part of the movie i enjoyed.in sum, stick to the original 1963 \"the haunting.\" 3/10 stars. No movie i've ever seen before has even come close to being as boring and stupid as this hunk of junk. and i have always been a big b-movie fan. after viewing this total piece of crap, though i can honestly say that this doesn't even come close to being a b-movie. no one in this movie could act if their life depended on it. the script is so stupid i don't think i've ever heard anyone talk like this in my life. the writer should go spend a few years studying real-life people to see just how they act and talk, even then they would not be able to make a watchable movie because it is so obvious that no one involved in this movie has any talent driving them at all. i could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys. also, forget about any sexy scenes, the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque, you would sooner puke than get turned on!avoid this pointless drivel unless you want to be bored out of your mind!. The story of ed gein is interesting, very interesting. this movie, however, interesting only in the fact that it was actually made. kane hodder's portrayal of ed gein is so far off, it's not even the slightest bit funny. ed gein did not behave psychotic in public, he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen, this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience. but the biggest mistake of this movie, side from even one frame ever being shot, was that ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother, whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave. he killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was god's will, and he was very remorseful about it, though that didn't stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing people's flesh. i officially gave this movie a rating of \"1\" simply because \"0\" wasn't given to me as an option.i highly advise all to stay clear of this movie. if you want to see a movie that accurately depicts ed gein and doesn't try to put in a sub-plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed, i highly advise you see the original movie, which unfortunately seems to not be on imdb.com though i could be wrong, but i have yet to find it here. the original doesn't stray from the actual events and doesn't try to twist the story. i can understand telling the story from a different perspective, but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself, something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 9/11, but gave it a twist that canada was behind it. or a wwii movie saying hitler was a good guy and helped fight the nazi's. Whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome. otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor (her downward phase), and richard burton (his miscasting phase). tennessee williams wrote \"the milk train doesn't stop here anymore\" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money.whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.it's so campy that among taylor fans it's probably considered a \"must see\" kind of thing. but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. sadly, this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two oscars. for burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb. judge for yourself if you dare. Adrian has just gone out of the asylum, being rich and with no parents, his life seems empty. one day, he meets gonzalo, a poor boy whom mother is prostitute. desperate for earning some money, gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents. this is a movie from a new director, and it is perfectly clear in most of the film: scenes not correctly directed, dialogues a little forced, some incoherences in the script...anyway, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little) and that saves a little the film. actors are known and with great quality, nevertheless, they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting; all of them have done better papers in other film. the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends. of course there are lots of worse films, but, sure, there are many many better ones. Only if its the last thing yo do and your humour is evaporated should you ever attempt to watch this. if you do, watch it alone invite no one, they will never return to watch another movie with you. it might be an excellent tool for that very purpose, invite people you want to get rid of in your life.apparently i need to write more about his film in order to qualify as a review. this is sweet irony for this film it really does sum it up perfectly. after wasting my time it wastes more of your time. it does have a function i take it all back.i recommend this film, watch it, its provocative, really go ahead watch it. \"opposing force [1986]\" wasn't as good as \"dr. strangelove\" and it wasn't as good as \"the bridge on the river kwai\". heck, it wasn't even as good as \"g.i. jane\", which is pretty sad.the film revolves around a basic ethical problem: in a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far can you go before you start breaking the law? what exactly is the law in such a situation? how can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone? can you intentionally inflict pain? how about breaking bones? mock executions? sexual abuse? severe blood loss? real guns with bullets? death? somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing \"acceptable\" from \"atrocious\".now, what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to vanish? what could you do? this movie attempts to portray this dilemma.i found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in \"resistance training\". i have a brother who went through the usaf's pow training program. according to him, it was pretty close to the mark technically.the film has a fairly good premise, but it doesn't have a particularly good story. i wondered if it might be based on some actual event, but it became pretty apparent that it wasn't when the explosions started. they must have changed scriptwriters three quarters into the film, because it takes a real extreme turn and devolves into a somewhat pointless shoot-em-up with lots of distracting explosions. i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending; again, kind of pointless. i'm left wondering what the point of the whole thing was - i'm beginning to suspect there simply wasn't one. it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks. I sat down to watch a documentary about puerto rico, and i ended up watching one about nuyoricans. when i go to puerto rico, i fail to see the 50% that live in poverty. when i do see struggling people, they are usually haitians, dominicans, or cubans that have recently arrived to the island. there is no such thing as spanglish... either you speak spanish, or you don't.... and from what i heard... you don't. pedro albizo campos is not mlk to me. mlk was a great man. campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1%. to the rest he as loco as osama bin laden. puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools. if you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent puerto rico see cuba, haiti, dominican republic, bahamas, all of south and central america, and mexico. its worked wonders for them. this documentary is not about puerto rico, this documentary was about the nuyoricans and their struggles.to the person that complaint that not enough of africa was on the show... it was suppose to be about puerto rico... not africa. denzel will make one shortly just for you.in conclusion... to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the us, and want to learn how the prime minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about puertorican culture. tell your kids to pay attention in geography, and history class.***update***bocabonita... \"doc.\" was about nuyoricans. she promoted it as if its how we all feel. should have been titled... \"yo soy nuyorican... lunche...can't speak spanish.\" please stop using puerto rico, rican, boricua, or anything else associated with pr with this nuyorican historical lesson. god forbid they play this on the island. Young spinster, who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom...but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night. sandy dennis is not a hapless actress, but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles i guess we'll never know. based on a book by richard miles, and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get, this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman (whose work is static, at best). the narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of \"the collector\", a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. even the film's best sequence (dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off, with sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs, but he's handled too bashfully by altman, with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here, she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen. as such, the abrupt finale is maddening, and the overall results tepid. *1/2 from ****. This is, quite literally, the worst movie i have ever watched in my life. it may be the worst movie possible. some movies are so bad that they're good; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. it is the anti-enantiodromia. we bought it with the intent to heckle, and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead, we sat in stunned silence, pitying poor peter sellers.this is worse than the animated lord of the rings. it is worse than the matrix sequels. it is worse than krull. it is worse than any batman movie.do not, under any circumstances, let this movie approach within ten feet of your television. I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more buster keaton films for imdb than any other person. every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early 30s with only two exceptions have i reviewed, so you can tell i am a major fan. it's because of this that i found this episode so painful and hard to watch. i loved this man's films and kept thinking \"buster, how could you?!\". well, now that i think about it, i guess i can see why buster keaton starred in this god-awful episode of the twilight zone. he'd lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well. now, in the 1960s, keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay--appearing in beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series.the biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and buster deserved much better. the show is supposed to be funny but isn't and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch--particularly with keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick. do yourself a favor, skip this one--it's a pale imitation of the greatness that once was keaton's career!!!. The subject this latest adman-turned-movieman tries to tackle in his debut (ad)venture is quite an age-old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance (pun intended).however, the exploration (and exploitation for desi auds) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to 'pepper, spice and sugar' up the usual masala mix of b/g score, dialog, dance, drama, etc creates a nice-looking package with not much inside.in the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times. further repeats follow thru-out the movie (after all the lead character's a cook). but therein lies les problemos -- no story! hah, no wonder. someone forgot to write a script.amitabh puts in a cheeni jyada (more) amount of over-acting. really when is this guy ever gonna stop?? how many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something??? timeless mind yes, but surely what about the not-so-ageless bod? and sole? sorry, soul?! reasonably good acting by paresh rawal who has the only sensible role in the film. the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new-fangled discovery of a hot new idea. nowhere are we presented with any real-life problems or issues such a pair might face, other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle. the sub-plot of a little kid with cancer (the bachelor boy's first love) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl's character.anyway, nice try but not quite there yet. It's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the \"garcea\" series or the \"vacanta mare\" child-plays... the difference is that mugur mihäescu, doru octavian dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as \"art\". pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good movie (\"duminicä la ora sase\") followed by another one, nice enough (\"reconstituirea\"), tries to declare his film-lenghts \"art works\" - but, unfortunately, he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression. as such, \"niki ardelean\" offers again a sample of \"how not\" - this being about its only merit. I would like to know who conned the producers of this movie to pay for its production - that persion is a genius of sorts. this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast. i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on, but nothing really was. it was not scary. the dialog was poorly written. the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episode.at this point i'm just mad that i wasted all that time. that's a couple hours that i will never get back.i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening. take a nap or hit the gym instead. or if you want to be scared, turn on a cable news channel. I watched this film with a bunch of friends at a halloween party last night. i got to say that the sarcastic comments were never ending and i have to say that they were well deserved. though i felt that the directing was done well, the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. i think i got about an hour into this before i even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home. you catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them, it's just a little too slow. this movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better. the only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that i downed during the course of the flick. bring on the slasher films folks, because at least i know what to expect out of them. this was not my thing, too much dark humour, and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross. i have to say that randy quaid played the part as well as it could have been, and i will give him props for that as i normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens.in conclusion i give this horror/comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10. This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the \"actors\" (with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip, all of the \"performers\" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. the \"new\" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading(?) this film, while boasting a creative premise ala 'dead men don't wear plaid', is a technical and creative wreck. in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to 'fog island', whatever that is! the \"flashback\" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. unrelated scenes from 'the lost world' (1925), the most dangerous game (1932), white zombie (1932), bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla (1952) and some other poverty row productions. this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera.the \"filmmakers\" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors (carradine, zucco, ouspenskaya, etc..etc..). this tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in 'final destination' here it's just obnoxious! bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about spiderman, dracula, and superman abound. even the old as dirt 'dewey, cheetam and howe' lawyer reference is used here-this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s.the film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi. the finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy.truth be told though, it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. maybe thats what they wanted to happen!. Sundown - featuring the weakest, dorkiest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unfitting, pretentious scores ever written - and with shane the vampire, who's every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that i burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest.the vampires don't seem to have any special powers at all - except for strength (sometimes), being able to switch off a lamp with their mind (one time) and... that's it, really. ever imagine count dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight 'cause he ran out of bullets? neither did i. practically any other movie-dracula would eat this one for breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks.the main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight - dracula's vs. some old geezer's. it could have been some good old b-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously, and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats, mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay.in the end it's just too silly to be funny. sure, it has some amusing moments, but they're few, and far apart. A stale \"misfits-in-the-army\" saga, which half-heartedly attempts to be both surreal (the foreign subtitles) and vulgar (the flatulence gags), but just ends up being a mix of many different kinds of humor, none of them followed very successfully. barbara bach, the bond girl from \"the spy who loved me\", has only two or three brief scenes. what a waste! (*1/2). Most of the french films i've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but that's okay. i found them interesting, well-photographed and with intriguing actors. (however, i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made! it seemed that way.)this movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening. but then it became talk, talk and more talk....which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery. after awhile, i almost fell asleep watching this.actually, the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room. thus, if you love plays, you should like this...but i want a little more bang for a murder story. This movie is really bad, trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the history of the movie. there are so many things i could point about the movie that i could almost write a book on how much the movie sucks. for instance, there were like 50 people on the plane, they killed like 100 and they kept coming, apparently the \"virus\" gives hepatic complications because everybody had yellow eyes, also the virus makes people roar like lions or something, and the virus not only regenerates tissue as it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus messes up peoples hair. it's also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol (probably only happens on planes) that person is kicked back in the air. remember that if you are escorting a prisoner on a plane and you loose him, always look inside the drawers and cabinets the size of a bottle, you never know where those bastards are going to hide. and if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive (happens all the time), after watching dozens of people being killed, just walk away from the plane, watching the sunrise and making jokes about dating the flight attendant. :). I'm not sure what the point of making this film was. it looked as if it was made by some historical society to be shown in your local 'pistol pete' museum. at first it appears that it could be the beginning of a mad tv or snl sketch. but then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking this seriously. the story wasn't bad but the inclusion of the sass members seemed to be a ploy (that worked) to get me to see the film. i swear, the trailer listed every character in the film down to \"dead cowboy #5\". the reason westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. i just had the feeling i was watching civil war rean-actors dressed up as cowboys. not even worth the digital video it was recorded on. As a spanish tourist in los angeles and a fanatic movie lover i committed a terrible mistake. i went to see \"the women\" the remake of one of my all time favorites. i've seen the original many many times, in fact i own it. my rushing to see the remake was based on diane english, the woman responsible for \"murphy brown\" my though was: how bad can it be? she must know what she's doing. well, i don't know what to say. i don't understand what happened. the botoxed women is a rather depressing affair. meg ryan or whoever played mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of meg ryan...another actress perhaps wearing a meg ryan mask - she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what norma shearer did in 1939. the new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. the \"friends\" annette bening, debra messing, jada pinket smith are as disconnected as anything i've ever seen and if this wasn't enough: eva mendes as crystal, the character created by joan crawford in one of her best and funniest performances. eva mendes's casting is really the poster sign for how wrong, how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up. i didn't give it a 1 out respect for candice bergen and cloris leachman. I'll give credit where credit is due, and say that linda fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants. she's brash, sassy, hard-edged, and very sexy; she is much better than this film deserves.but that is it. this dull suspense film is a fragmented mess, attempting at once to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy erotic thriller. the film, my friends, isn't thrilling in the slightest.for instance, who thought of casting c. thomas howell as a desirable leading man? he is not ugly, but for crying out loud, it looks as though fiorentino's tough-cookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher. howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role.the script is by far the worst aspect of the film. there is no tension as fiorentino's character gets eerie phone calls, there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of liberation as fiorentino gets wimpy howell to lose his inhibitions.look for interesting but poorly-done cameos by adam ant and issac hayes, and one really, really good sex scene between howell and fiorentino. besides that, my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else. This is probably the worst film i have ever seen. mike myers tries to be a dramatic actor and fails miserably. the children, who have the major roles, are almost impossible to understand and are really unpleasant characters. it was not even worth the price of the rental. This film is too skeletal. it's a fairly low-budget film (i hope!) which excuses it somewhat, but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much. phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family who's searching for himself (though his family is...er...well, a little too white...), but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws. every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are *way* too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency. they needed filler...) i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard-core phillips fan, or who has absolutely *nothing* to do. 4/10. The bone collector is set in new york city & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts lincoln rhyme (denzel washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. jump forward four years & alan (gary swanson) & his wife lindsay rubin (olivia birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after new york cop amelia donaghy (angelina jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of alan. amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of lindsay. having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for rhyme & the police...directed by phillip noyce i watched the bone collector last night & i have to say it's one of the worst big budget post the silence of the lambs (1991) & se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers i have seen, in fact it makes friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! the script by jeremy iacone was based on the book by jeffery deaver & is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin. for a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. the character's are truly awful & i didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. first we have lincoln rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. he is seemingly impressed with amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, i'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? why is he so impressed with her? then there's capatin cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain? then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target rhyme anything else. also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! how did that happen? i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. it's never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? i mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of new york to choose from? there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going. there is so much wrong with the bone collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.with a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 the bone collector is well made with good production values & that hollywood gloss about it. i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen, i think she is absolutely terrible in this. denzel washington just sort of lies there really, queen latifah is awful & even michael rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd & one dimensional character.the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while, i saw it for free on telly last night & i still feel cheated & ripped-off. there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? works either way to be honest... Or \"marlowe at sea\". yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey. quite talky, too. bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, calls women \"slim\" and \"dames\" and other such nonsense, is the only \"real male\" i.e. alpha male in the movie (the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha male male), and - naturally - every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction. the character clichés are all here. bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic-about-to-reform as in \"casablanca\", and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him? it doesn't, so he can't be a cynic; hawks wanted it both ways: a character who is both the \"cool lone cynic\" and yet a well-meaning humanitarian. i don't think so... bacall does her non-chalant \"cool babe\" routine for the first time, and there are plenty of overrated, not all-too interesting so-called \"sexual innuendo\" exchanges between her and bogey; these dialogues sound silly by today's standards. \"just purse your lips and whistle...\". a load of crap... she was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older, and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day. her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland, the cuteness of a myrna loy, let alone the likability of an irene dunne. bacall was more suited for playing vampires, not femme-fatales. (in real life she is very much like her face: a hollywood bitch.) there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears; very unsuitable for her character. there are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready.if you're interested in reading my \"biographies\" of bogart, bacall, huston, and other hollywood personalities, contact me by e-mail. Hannibal must be the most god-awful movie i have seen in a long time. in fact, i want my money back. what a waste of time. no plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. what else can i say? if you haven't seen it don't bother. i wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on tv... change the channel. the only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it). if you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.what was the purpose of this movie? its like someone just asked 'i wonder what hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride. he is free in the beginning and he's free at the end. in between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of anthony hopkins and the film makers. julianne moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as i'm concerned she was set up to fail.in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. the only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.i give it a big fat raspberry!. ..oh wait, i can! this movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like \"continuity editing\" and \"geographic match\". i couldn't tell where i was in this movie. one second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. i think. i couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. i think it only got attention because it has a 3d which i did not watch. if you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie i mean bad movie, then this film is for you. it's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni, though, just skip this one. I have no respect for imdb ratings anymore. i think a bunch of mormons flooded the website and voted for this. this is not an artistic movie, it is mormon propaganda. nothing wrong with that, but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading. if you are a bible thumping christian or a mormon, watch this movie, you'll love it and think it is truly amazing. for anyone else, don't bother, the story is so contrived, random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way. this guy tries to commit suicide cause he sleeps with his neighbor. are you kidding? what a pussy! anyways, this is an awful movie. This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: not recommended to normal people.the obsession of daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare. also, it's evident that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everybody - his country his people, his actors, his job. and this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago.this so called \"film\" is just a hideous string of disgusting images, with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge. it is an insult to good taste and to good sense. shame, shame, shame!. Gargoyle starts late one night in 'romania 1532' as a peasant girl (daniela nane) travels along in her horse & cart minding her own business when from the moonlit clouds above a living gargoyle swoops down & attacks her, she manages to escape the gargoyle & happens upon a castle of some description where an angry mob of local villagers & a priest are able to put an end to the gargoyle, or so they think... cut to present day bucharest where two cia agents ty griffin (michael pare) & jennifer wells (sandra hess) are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a rich american ambassador from his kidnappers. in pursuit of one of the kidnappers griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a large pool of blood & no visible signs of what happened to him. meanwhile dr. christina durant (kate orsini) & her colleague richard barrier (jason rohrer) are renovating a church when the church labourer gregor (mihai bisericanu) informs richard that he has found some ancient relic, the two investigate & find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons & one very angry & very much alive gargoyle who wastes no time in killing them both. griffin & wells are on the case when they are reported missing & soon realise that local legends of monstrous gargoyles are true with a local priest named father soren (fintan mckeown) planning to flood the world with them...co-written, co-produced & directed by jim wynorski under his usual pseudonym jay andrews gargoyles is yet another masterpiece wynorski can add to his credits, not. the script by wynorski, ion ionescu, a.g. lawrence & bill munroe is crap, is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. for a start i would like to know if there was only one gargoyle left who laid all those eggs because i'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. how did it survive in that hole for 500 years? what did it eat? how did the priest know it was there? why has no one else ever figured it out? why did the priest want to flood the world with them? to rule it? the gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world & then let some priest just rule it like a king & if they did what would be left to rule? much like the guys who wrote gargoyle i don't think he thought it through that well did he? whichever way i look at it, whichever way i approach it, from whichever angle i try to figure it out from, no matter how many times i try to square the circle gargoyles just doesn't make any sense & they story has huge plot holes, lapses in logic & isn't that great to start with anyway. the character's are dull & clichéd, the action repetitive & unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through. people do illogical things & everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince griffin that gargoyle's exist & one just suddenly shows up & attacks them. the cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of aliens (1986) it's embarrassing & the ending was lame. the bit on the large ferris wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights & forced him to get on it.director wynorski cuts costs & steals footage from other films, in fact the best scene from gargoyle is a car chase through bucharest but it was taken from the jean-claude van damme action film maximum risk (1996). there are no shocks, scares or atmosphere. the special effects are terrible, the cgi gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game & has little interaction with any living cast members, there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky & trying to appear scarred. there isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable, there is one awful decapitation & that's it.technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable, the romanian locations look suitably romanian. gargoyle went straight-to-video & it shows with a pretty cheap look & feel to it. the acting isn't up to much, personality bypass victim michael pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes.gargoyle is a crap film, it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. a total waste of 90 minutes as far as i'm concerned, one to avoid. Burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions. he'd show up, party with his friends on film, and take home a big paycheck. it didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap.no film epitomized this more than \"stroker ace\" which makes \"cannonball run\" look like a classic and \"cannonball run ii\" look watchable. save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here. even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing.if the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie. otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't be any worse. Leonard nimoy directed star trek iii, which wasn't half bad. maybe william shatner thought seeming as how nimoy did it he could. after seeing this film he should have reversed that decision.star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series. the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards. she looked like she was taking part in a granny competition. if they meant to make her look sexy. they were wrong. she looked grotesque.how this got to production or even written...well it dosen't bear thinking about. the only place good for this film is in the garbage. the worst one of the series. I consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seen.the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous. i get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown, but it got so silly and boring, after a while i could have cared less about any of the characters.the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot. the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there.then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer, and the confusing ones where he meets himself.i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didn't recognize any of the actors. do yourself a favor when this movie comes up, read a book! you'll be better off. Director fabio barreto got a strange academy nominea for his last movie o quatrilho. quatrilho is a bad movie, but in bella donna, barreto did one of the worst movies of all time. his adaptation of the novel riacho doce is ridiculous. think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english? in the film they do. there isn't a screenplay, it's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with moscovis and henstridge. At the very beginning, the look at a control panel that reads \"8 miles of the cost of california\", and no, i didn't misspell that, they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast. these people must have been morons.it's good if you're into terrible movies, but the sheer fact they couldn't catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didn't put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever. the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoever.wow, completely ridiculous, but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch. how these folks made any money off this is beyond me. I've come to realise through watching this sort of film that i don't like them very much. caged women is yet another 'women in prison' film, and like the most of the rest of the genre; the plot is completely forsaken in favour of simply showing nude women. now don't get me wrong; i love nude women, but i also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity, and since this film has only the basic 'women are in prison' theme running through it (aswell as the essential escape, of course), i got a bit bored before the end. the film is good because there's barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes, but that's about the only positive element. director (and writer, ha ha) erwin c. dietrich delights in showing close-ups of the naked female body, but it's never very erotic. the director was the producer on a number of trash flicks, including some directed by jess franco. in my opinion, he should stick to producing as his writing talents are non-existent, and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene. this sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time, but i reckon franco could have made more out of it. overall, this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff; but i can't say i enjoyed it. This picture hit the movie screens on june 6th 1980, starring stephen macht as sergeant thor, avery schreiber as captain comelius butt, j.d. hinton as buzz and starring playmate of the year dorothy stratton. the picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for i guess criminals. there ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. enters sergeant thor and his partner buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. when failing they call on captain comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. enters the gorgeous dorothy stratton, who plays the role of galaxina who is man made robot. an now a few thoughts on this picture. this movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that i don't get into sci-fi. if you're into sci-fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci-fi movie titled battlestar galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another sci-fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled star trek. now for the reason that i bought this movie, dorothy stratton. she is gorgeous in her one piece suit. i think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. connie sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. on the picture alone i give this movie 1 weasel star and on dorothy stratton i give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. if you like pictures like this you can get the dvd version on amazon.com. I like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa, because in germany you can't get it anywhere. i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the subspecies or puppetmaster series, because they were full of atmosphere.i was glad when the movie finally arrived.but after watching this cheesy movie, i was very disappointed. the actors ( i think you can't even say actors) are boring and untalented. the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy.i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie. :-). Maybe i'm really getting old, but this one just missed me and the old funny bone completely. surely there must be something powerful wrong with this irishman (that's me, schultz!). lordy, lordy what i would give to see the light! firstly, that phil silvers manic energy, wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life, if you will. although it is possible that the series, first titled: \"you'll never get rich\" (1955-59*) could have gotten on the cbs tv network with someone else in the title role of sgt. bilko, it is very hard to picture any other actor/comedian in the business wearing those master sergeant's stripes.such a strong identification is inescapable, though not the same sort of career-wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys, like clayton more(\"the lone ranger\"), george reeves (\"the adventures of superman\") and charles nelson riley (\"uncle croc's block\").one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's tv screen to the 1990's movie-going public is our collective memory. without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals, and their numbers were surely considerable; even a large segment of the young had seen bilko reruns in recent times. it was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apart.so as not to be thought of as a totally square, old grouch please let's consider some other points.right here today, the 14th day of november in the year of our lord 2007, let me swear and affirm under oath that i have been a steve martin fan for nearly 30 years, furthermore, i've enjoyed the wit and talents of bilko '96 co-stars dan akroyd and the late phil hartman. after all, it was the talents of guys like this and so many others, alumni of \"nbc;s saturday night\" and \"second city tv\" that kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing. but a bilko re-make; it just didn't click.perhaps if the film had been made as a service comedy (always liked 'em!) but without the bilko show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby, old guys like me.so, we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately, what's next? howse about somebody doing hal roach's world war ii army comedy series of sergeants doubleday & ames and tv's 1st cartoon series \"crusader rabbit\"? remember where you heard it first! poodle schnitz!. Extremely formulaic with cosmic-sized logic holes and a pretense at comedy. aw, poor nyc lawyer! he's just scraping by, and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesn't go out to find another job, though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. we see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he can't stand up to anyone in his firm. at home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house.the only character you want to root for is the final maid, who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new year's eve because she feels sorry for them! (the bit's not played for laughs.)sorry, just too unbelievable and with a **spoiler** pat, everyone-turns-180-degrees ending. how'd they get top-notch stars for this? if i'd been at the studio i'd have sent this one back for a complete rewrite. Lynch. the man has some really great stuff! he knows how to disturb us, then reward us by getting us think in different ways. this, however, is altogether different. dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. i may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast-forward. didn't miss a thing. i felt relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point with this series. it's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded out with annoying animation, voices and sound. but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile. Trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi-devout mormons, and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film. finally kurt hale's fortunes have changed (thank goodness) and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters.the cinematography was amateurish (i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). the plot was limp and very unfunny. you really didn't understand why anyone did anything. it was like i had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was that painful.the only reason i didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me. Three story lines and not enough tying them together, \"inside man\" was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. though having its moments, the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. i will give credit to denzel washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical \"super-detective\" with all the answers. clive owen also did quite well with his duality part as \"evil genius\" and \"criminal mastermind\" (both not the same in retrospect). overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section. yet, when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden \"ah-ha!\" or summation of everything. it all ended up with very little of the energy it began with, with a lot of plot-holes, tons of questions, and as i said earlier, no where near spike lee's normal level. i have to completely disagree with the so-called \"professional critics\"... this is not the movie they play it up to be. Othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film. the bad depiction of shakespeare's characters, and the terrible rendition of the love that desi & john had, made this movie the horrendous filth that it is. by far, othello, directed by jeffery saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and desi. their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend. in the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between john and desdemona is inseparable beyond belief. moments later, ben jago, john's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is. by far, this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself. with that being said, it does have a miniscule amount of good parts. for example, the love that was shown between john and desi, was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book. although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealously that othello had between cass and desi as well as it should. love, jealously, deceitfulness, this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel. the novel however, really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could. for example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. much more detail is also put into the novel. this is why this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it will find it disappointing as well. in conclusion, this film was by far, the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind. by avoiding to see this film, not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives, but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of ben jago popping out at them. I am a huge jane austen fan and i ordered the movie from amazon.uk just so i could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the u.s. i really should have saved my money. what is with anne running after wentworth? the whole point of anne elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. she is not impulsive and vulgar. and mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? her speech wasn't normal, nor was her walking normal. there was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole \"romance\" completely unbelievable. in the final scene they even have sally hawkins wearing the same dress amanda root wore during the letter scene. the same clothes do not make it the same movie. in my opinion they didn't watch the 1995 version, which even though it had it's flaws, it did stay pretty close to the book. the book, i don't even think they read it. this is kind of like a cliff's notes movie of persuasion. hit on all the high points without explaining anything. One of the worst excuses for an irish accents i've heard. from a truly great actor too. its a bad irish accent not to mention a dublin accent (which is completely different) anyway the film is loosely based around the story of ganglord martin cahill and its done much much much better with brendan gleeson in the title role in the general. Ok, just what the hell is all this supposed to mean??? halloween 6 (let's just call it that, ok?) is, without a doubt, the most confusing film in the series (and from what i've heard, seeing the original \"producers cut\" doesn't sound like it makes things any less bewildering than the \"official\" release). what a mess.this isn't a really bad film, as some have said. it has its scary scenes and some rather intense moments - it just doesn't make any sense! don't tell me that michael was \"engineered\" from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. it was bad enough when they turned michael into jamie lee curtis' brother (just so they had an excuse to keep her in the second film) - this is too much.it would seem this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be \"too smart\" by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all. bad move, guys. we're not looking for an explanation of why michael kills, so please don't try and feed us this crap. show me michael looking menacing and killing a bunch of people. show me dr. loomis trying to track him down and, as always, coming up just short. don't waste (what turned out to be) the last performance of donald pleasance by telling me (in the most confusing way possible) that michael was \"created\" by some cult from hell and that his \"seed\" will be passed on to another and... oh, brother.halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong, and we all know there have been far worse sequels than this (hellraiser, anyone?) so get what you can out of it (the scene toward the end of the film with michael charging down a deep red corridor is particularly effective) and try to ignore the screwball plot. hopefully one day we can all see the \"producer's cut\" and maybe get the chance to make (a bit) more sense out of all of this. till then, this will have to do...-ftm. I cannot remember a more trivial, mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind. how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others ? only if they don't like admitting they made a mistake. it seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations. no real substance to it all happy and shallow. yeah that'll please the masses. well not this member of the masses. what a trivial load of drivel. i wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. and to think i paid £7 to see this ! i think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days. so i like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what ?. I'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic. the little girl was a brat, their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked. besides it wasn't even a gator as the film would like us to believe. if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile, not a gator. obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc. it is a sad excuse for a movie. especially the ending. i nearly fell asleep with this one. I loved the original p.h. and was somewhat satisfied with bloodwings (ii)and ashes to ashes (iii), then i saw part iv. oh boy..... as a pumpkinghead enthusiast, i did my best to give part 4 as much credit as i could, but it's pretty bad. the wedding reception fight right at the beginning of the film is a horrendous mess for one thing. the hatfield and mccoy storyline is incomprehensibly stupid and cliché. how did the producers get away with using that tired family feud storyline? wow, unbelievable. the acting, besides henrickson, is below average. the plot and script are mind-numbing. the actual editing and cinematography are average, as is the directing. i mean, the movie isn't a total loss. as always: i really enjoy watching pumpkinhead, i love seeing haggis the witch, and like watching harley's ghost in action. but all three characters had way too much screen time. i thought haggis and harley would wind up going out to a supper club for an evening bite to eat and drinks, the way the were being so buddy buddy in her cabin. the bottom line is.... is that i wanted all the characters in this puke fest of a plot line to be dead within 20 minutes of the start of the picture. where does sci-fi get these so called \"film production professionals\" from anyway!? i could do a better job writing a script stone cold drunk. i'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! see it if your a fan of the other three, but just once. and then go back and stick to the original two. shame on you sci-fi!!!!. What on earth was that? my family and i just waisted 2 hours of our life for this piece of rubbish !!! there was no plot, no tension, only a lot of boredom !!! my kids could do better movies with our video-camera.but maybe we just did not get the point of the movie...oh wait, my mum did. she was the only one who liked it for the following reason: \"at least a film with no cars screeching...\" if you are looking for a war-film with no fighting in it, is still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti-war-message, then you should watch \"the trench\".i give this film 3 out of 10 because it is good enough for an afternoon-nap and because i am too nice... This movie had mediocrity, laziness, and thoughtlessness written all over it. if you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already, then you better do a damn good job. i'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. some scary/horror movies just fail to break the mold of the \"lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies\" cliché. this one, sadly, was no different, and like all scary movies, once you venture down that road there is no going back.and the ending? how do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie, but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end? the ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 which i will never watch. terrible movie. An italian/american co-production co-starring linda blair and david 'the hoff' hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?well, based on the uneventful, extremely tedious, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, i would have said 'very easily'; thankfully, however, things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).the hoff stars as gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie (leslie cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project, a book about witches; whilst there, frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity.his plans for nookie are scuppered, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks (robert champagne and annie ross), their pregnant daughter jane (blair), son tommy (michael manchester), pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan (catherine hickland), and estate agent jerry (rick farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel.after explaining their unexpected presence on the island, gary and leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it perilous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (hildegard knef), who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. one by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs), before meeting a terrible fate.none of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (manchester as tommy is particularly bad, whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; jerry is crucified and burnt alive; linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and gary gets stabbed in the back.oh, and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed (again). Evan almighty (2007) ** steve carell, morgan freeman, lauren graham, johnny simmons, graham phillips, jimmy bennett, john goodman, wanda sykes, john michael higgins, jonah hill, molly shannon, ed helms, (cameo: jon stewart as himself) strained 'sequel' to \"bruce almighty\" with carell's jerk anchorman evan baxter leaving tv to begin his stint as a freshman congressional rep has his hands full when god (freeman reprising his holy role; jim carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have). the godforsaken sitcom-y script by steve oedekerk, joel cohen & alec sokolow is absolutely lame and only carell's amiable persona transcends his vain evan into something resembling a human being. the end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 m for the cgi f/x). sykes steals the show as evan's sarcastic assistant. sacrilegiously unfunny. (dir: tom shadyac). Why?!! this was an insipid, uninspired and embarrassing film. the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it...pittsburgh pa! why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie there?when this movie was originally to be released...it was more of a romantic comedy...and no robo-anything. that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney. why???? they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either. sheesh!!. This is one of the more poorly made movies i've ever seen. one has to take anything by truffaut seriously; it's not just some b-movie cranked out by hacks.evidently truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. among other things, how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as julie/marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuve's. the cliché ending (which i won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake. If this is based on the true-life relationship, as purported, between ms. curtin and mr. levinson, i'm thrilled i do not know them personally. this is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground. many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy. Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. i had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. this would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). i was very disappointed. This movie doesn't even deserve a 1/10 this movie was a scam.i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were deliberetly copied from carnosaur 1, 2, & 3.the whole movie \"raptor\" was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a \"thriller, action packed, dinosaur\" copy. i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to.i recommend you see the carnosaur movie first (all of them) and then watch this, and you will know what i mean.- spencer. I, also having endured hundreds of children's movies in the past, consider this to be one of the worst i have ever seen.1) i resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not \"the bad guys\". also, that mocking russian names like \"poopchev\" is inappropriate.2) the grandfather fly's birthday party scene contained a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone. two other flies also needlessly use the word \"crap\" twice.3) the whole movie largely smacks of 1950's stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we, as a nation, were proud to have risen above.in all it's just crude, badly animated, even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view. In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything \"real\" about this legend need to grow up. this is the 21st century. guess what: ghosts don't exist. most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. you guys seriously need to grow up.the fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. the fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from tennessee believe it doesn't do it either. go to college. or at least finish high school. This movie wasn't good. i thought it'd be a cute disney movie just like the original. wrong. it was awkward for christina ricci, whom i expect so much more than this, you could just tell by watching. i think doug e. doug did the best he could. sit 5 year olds in front of the this, any older, and they might start to fall asleep. This 3-hour made-for-tv miniseries came home with us from blockbuster's this weekend. the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costuming (bridget fonda, especially), and special effects (including a great jim henson talking polar bear & reindeer). they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script. the story line was so loose that it really never came together. one can overlook irish-accented germans, but not herky-jerky storytelling. with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil, this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic. a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads. I agree that this film wasted my time and my money. the poster mislead me to thinking it was a different type of movie. i should have known given the unprofessional look of the poster. someone should sue for false advertising. I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of greenaways output. however it was his usual mix of \"art\" sex and pretentious crap.i know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly. it is definitely not for everyone. the ubiquitous mcgregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time. i hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies. i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!. Although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget, that's not what i go to movies for. there wasn't one character i found sympathetic, they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers. everything they attempt ends badly, it's all too hopeless for me. reviews refer to the puffy chair as a black comedy...comedy? the brother rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution. when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother, he almost hints at rhett not playing with a full deck. nonetheless josh performs a \"wedding\" for rhett and a woman rhett met just a few hours before. there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road. however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film...and i saw it at a free screening. This is one of the strangest things on tv. it is set in a bizarrely underpopulated midlands superb called leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. it features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. the story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem. pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value, but i cannot believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama. bonkers. I admire 'kissing on the mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director joe swanberg. they weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday \"private\" occurrences. unfortunately, the film falls under the 'the brown bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. yes, it mirrors 'bunny' with a whole lot of nothing going on, or too many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing  feet, hands or genitals. again, unfortunately, i can see why this film was released, and why people are renting: true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. other than that, it was a complete waste of time. we quickly learn of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. other than that, we are subjected to the every-day events of their boring lives: she works for her parents; he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. for this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real. neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. 'the brown bunny.' the only actor that stands out is kate winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) again, i admire the filmmakers, especially swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls flat. it has narrations that doesn't fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder, other than the soft-porn factor, why you rented this. This was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered. the cinematography was dull, with long tedious shots (like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play) interspersed with \"dramatic\" angles that made little sense to the content on screen. the editing was terrible, scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher. the plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote frankenstien. the acting was forced, with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better). Judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxto give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsthe film however is damn melodramatic, many places ridiculousone wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife? when he earns so much just to show how poor he is?the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the johny- paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the storyeven there are several cringeworthy scenesdirection by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedanil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny, paresh irritates farida is decent. The strawberry blond has a great script, but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney, he's not the person for the part. i do think olivia did a great job. this movie is also a day dream wrap around, so it's hard to follow. i don't like the male character attitude; the way cagney presented it was just off. i give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character. ( if you like tough ruff men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie). the strawberry blond would have been better if the main character had more of a positve attitude, and change the script so he is happy he's with oliva.this movie points out money does not bring happiness, women right jokes. plain and simple not the best movie, but every one must decide for themselves. This woman never stops talking throughout the movie. she memorized every line, and delivered all without a bit of natural emotion. she also has a most uncharming lisp, and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. this film has way too much betsy drake, and not enough cary grant, who carried what little was left of the film entirely on his own. Whoa. i mean, whoa. i mean, whoa whoa.i saw this movie, waaay back when i was eight, in 1996. back then, cgi films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. also, back then we listened to things called cd players. but i digress. i used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, i've held reaally fond memories of it. hey, it's don bluth! anyone who hates \"all dogs go to heaven\" is clearly a robot. but, again, i digress.then, i saw it again. this really isn't one of his best, i can say now, eleven years later. i've seen a lot more films, and i've garnered a little bit more knowledge. now, sure, the voice acting is good, i'll give 'em that. story's...okay. i mean, we see it all the time. a lot. but, it works. the musical numbers are what irk me. this would've been more at home in the eighties, with these kind of musical numbers. in '96, most kids movies had epic numbers, like the lion king (which came out a year or so previous, but whatever)or stuff like that. you get showtunes here, vaudeville style.the animation kind of hurts, too. at times choppy, and at others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot, it's really hard not to notice.i still like \"all dogs go to heaven, but this could've been waaay better.4/10. Although the beginning suggests all quiet on the western front, this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary. this depicts the funnest war ever fought, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times.when we finally see some battle, it is lame: an enemy plane flies over? shoot it down (in one shot). sniper in the tree? kill him before he gets a shot off. enemy soldiers in the woods? not to worry, they gladly surrender. ho-hum.tepid, turgid, predictable... I have watched the root of all evil with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . i don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.he is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2/1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in godhe regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do god. one has only to look at the language used in his postulations. regarding faith. this commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour. just think about it. when he gets in an electrician be believes that it will be wired correctly and trustfully turns on the switch. when he gets in a plumber he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. regarding faith in science when i was in chemistry class i believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons both of which have now been discounted. i was taught this as the atomic theory 'writ in stone' so to speak. so why should we believe any scientist especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field? dawkins states that religion will be the downfall of civilisation. religion is civilisation. can he, or any other atheist, please tell us what civilisation was founded and nurtured by atheism, barbarism or savagery please? he is now living in the last stages of a christian based civilisation and taking all the benefits from it without any admission for its source. i found dawkins to be arrogant, dictatorial, judgmental, an obvious believer in eugenics and a nazi in his attitude towards the young. how dare he say what a parent can teach their child. the child is theirs, not the nation's and as the parents bequeath to it their genetics, so do they bequeath their beliefs. his dismissal of adam as \"he never existed\" as he has no proof was an example of this same attitude. so i have no proof that joe blogs lives in new york but he well may do. i just haven't found the proof yet. that does not negate his existence i note his argument with the bishop of oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the bible. well, dawkins also does this. where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement? he is also selective. i heard the lot when dawkins came up with the altruistic gene. what a hoot. he is desperately looking for proof for his wackiness and as the piltdown man was invented, so now we have this so called altruistic gene which predisposes us to looking after our young and other members of our 'group' the trouble is that all animals do this - not just apes, and with evolution it is survival of the fittest. not the kindest and if he really thinks we are becoming kinder as a race he is not reading the same newspapers as i am i found his arrogance beyond belief in declaiming that as we only have this life, we should enjoy it to the full. so how does he equate this with his obvious position as a well off european to a destitute person in africa who has had all her family wiped out and probably raped and is starving. will he help her? i note that all his opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. well g k chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b) we are against using contraception and abortion and homosexuality. all sins against the 6th commandment. funny that.as a catholic i find his dismissal of pius xii's pronouncement of the dogma of the assumption in 1958 to be erroneous. he , pius, never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere by himself. in case dawkins does not know it, revelation ended with the last apostle. pius would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed from down over the centuries to have come up with this pronouncement. also as a catholic i find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied. what utter rubbish. we, everyday fight the world, the flesh and the devil. we are the church militant. we are also able to glory at a sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in god. the trouble with dawkins was that he interviewed whacky zealots and extrapolated them to all of us. Most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters. they rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order. they added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never happen.if i hadn't read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film, it didn't make you care about the characters, like them or dislike them. it turns the characters into jokes.awful.ridiculous.waste of two hours of my life. Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it. that raw plot line is, i'll admit, a pretty good idea. although this show was meant for children, a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws. first, zoey is a cliché character, her being super popular, super attractive, super smart, and there;s nothing wrong with her; no girl is like that. it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie lynn spears and increase her fame. dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just plain mean. however, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of them all, which is sad seeing that dana is never nice. nicole is too peppy and acts like a complete airhead, but mysteriously gets straight a's. lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmy-deserving acting skills. quinn is supposed to be super smart, and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things, she is also made out to be weird, and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart, while zoey, lola, and nicole get guys and they're all beauty and no personality. chase and michael are very similar, and i even sometimes get them confused. logan is unrealistically rich, and hands out millions like they're dollars. nobody's that rich. i've also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that stacy girl, who does nothing but act nice to them. that's not funny! that's mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people. finally, the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5-star amenities such as a scenic location, sushi bar, hot lounge equipped with free soda machines, pool&jacuzzi, movie theater, and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other sex's dorm rooms. at most boarding schools, if a boy were to go into a girl's dorm or vice versa they would be expelled.in conclusion, zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the drafting process. I am surprised that everyone (even the critics) seems to think this was a good movie. it was the most clichéd thriller ever made that i have seen. we have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. the 'good girl' in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her loved ones. using charisma, bravery, and even luck to save the day. where to begin? well, a young woman by the name of lisa reisert meets a young man by the name of jackson rippner (nice name) at an airport. one coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together. sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seemingly getting along in every way... is there more to this strangeness? could these two be meant for each other? does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounter? well, as it turns out, unfortunately yes. jackson needs to lisa to help him assassinate the director of homeland security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him. oh, if she doesn't do this then her father is dead. though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in lisa's best interest to help him.of course, lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck, makes him trip over chairs, and hitting him with a field hockey stick. oh, and before that, she leads him on wild chase through miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father. yeah, right.first of all, i find it strange that a man like jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager. couldn't he just sneak a bomb into the building? wouldn't that make it safer for him and his team by leaving out any third parties? and why do characters like jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening? doesn't that make it easier to stop them by the same people? the actors did their best considering the movie they were given. racheal mcadams and cillian murphy are still actors to look out for. also, i believe that jayma mays (who played the 'loveable' cynthia) will be someone we will see more of. it's just too bad they all were stuck with this.2 out of 10. Neal n nikki is voted on of the worst films of the year by planetbollywood. its hard to believe the famous chopra's have produced this lousy movie. it was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. the title song is the most annoying song of the decade, i'm the neil, i'm the man, rock star superstar. uday chopra is one of bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent. after making many super flops, and not receiving any movies from a producer rather then his family. he gives a total crap performance, that bores you to death. tanisha, who is and will always be known for being kajol's sister, gives a dreadful performance. both actors have the most annoying chemistry, and are very immature for their age. it has a special appearance by the very cute richa pollad, in a pathetic role. the ending was so daft and stupid, i cant believe i actually paid money to rent this crap. I never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel (especially a beloved one, like evening) but when i saw that the book's author, susan minot, was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film, i thought that evening would be a good adaptation.if you enjoyed the book, don't bother with this movie. it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with harris. harris is the son of the housekeeper. buddy is a drunk, in love with ann and/or harris. i don't think a single character made it from the book to the screen; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment.and, really, didn't we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in, to scenes of our heroes' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights, simply does not work on film? this film is a disaster. skip it. This was shown on a premium channel, so i didn't realise it was made for tv. even so, i like some of the movies on lifetime (lifestyle here in uk), but this was awful. the family were so cheesy, \"love you mum\" \"love you even more honey\" then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, \"love you mum\" big cheesy smiles etc... she phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home. they were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead, have a nutter living next door, who needs help? she has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to look after her.however, as a comedy, i'd give it a good 7. i might even show it to my friends next time i have them round. could be great fun after a bottle of vodka or 10!. I hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity. hyung-rae shim is lucky that bad film-making isn't a capital crime or he'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster. i'm amazed that this film had a $75m budget, but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop, that shim will hopefully, never get to make another movie the rest of the life and, therefore, not waste any more of filmgoers time. i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now.with the effects resources available to them, a great film could have been made with this budget. as usual, the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story. \"transformers\" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this makes it look like \"citizen kane\". A collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes, edited together and with added voice-over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first. pretty cool idea, but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof. as it's just not as funny as \"anchorman\", and really let's face it that film wasn't exactly comedy gold either, so you get a 'movie' worse than one that was moderately funny. in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above \"kicking and screaming\", or \"bewitched\". chross your fingers that \"the wedding crashers\" is a return to old school form (no pun intended) my grade: d. This joins the endless line of corny, predictable 50's sci-fi shlock out there. as usual, it's pretty bad. there isn't much of a plot that i could detect and the over-exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs. the title is misleading also. catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed, and it's better left that way. I started watching this because i thought it was a really shitty porno. as i kept watching the only thrill i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and rip on it. i just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this movie.for the people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting, my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie. you are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie.there is no way that this is a serious movie. there was an old guy that gets stabbed and it doesn't even hurt him at all. and when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead.it was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body.my favorite part was when the old man found the \"hemoglobens\" or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd.what really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls.if you do attempt to see this movie, you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hairdryer in it and be ready to jump in.this is a must see!!!....for anyone who believes there life could not get any worse because this will help you realize there are people out there(the makers of this movie) who are even more pathetic and are going no where in life. Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between.essentially, this is a grade b blend of pop-psych thriller, ghost story and horror. drew barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family has been murdered and she was, in at least one case, the prime suspect), or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder? george newbern is her new room mate, and most of the action centers on him.newbern's character is pretty sympathetic, and both he and barrymore do decent work (though not exactly good). the mediocre to (at times) totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion. leslie hope's character is memorable, but so irritating that you will want to forget her.the plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated (one story arc is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) outlandish climax which is so badly conceived, acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously.overall, the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of m. knight shamalyan's first undergraduate film class. the acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them - at least until the film derails utterly and completely.my recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid a first-person encounter. I don't really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation. unfortunatly it was misplaced. firstly this is not horror, it doesn't scare and (unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for - which is possible) doesn't try to. it's a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1. this film ripps of gremlins in a truly special way, i can't claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more. very, very bad - avoid. I gave this movie a 2, and though i consider myself a science fiction fan, i found this movie very difficult to take seriously. it was on amc one late night, and i'm glad i saw it for free. this movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more.the special effects are about average for the time period - not awful, but not great, either. of course we know more about mars now than we did back then, but we really can't hold that against this film. the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the story.there were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail - the astronaut's injury/condition, the city on mars, the creature in the lake, etc. overall, the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of the outer limits - complete with a cheesy ending. So it's a space movie. but it's low budget. you ask, \"what about the effects?\" the effects are at times good, and at times really, really bad. i mean bad. and notice i started with the effects.there's a story here, but it's told in what i think is the wrong order. i don't mean a tarantino style wrong order. i mean, it's told in a completely nonsensical arrangement. most of it's about a mother (in the future, because you know, it's sci-fi) as told by her daughter, which is mostly exposition done in narrative from the daughter's perspective. only once you're through the first hour and hear paul darrow's voice as a computer do you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if he'd read it. this narrative is so constant and inclusive, that the actors on screen hardly say a word for the first hour.there's also a lesson here for you up and coming filmmakers: if you're not doing 2001 and want to have some action (this one does), then please hire a good fight choreographer. otherwise, your fights will look like, well, what's in battlespace. and notice the title has the word \"battle\" in it. ugh.i think this might be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. and some effects. my biggest surprise is seeing the imdb listing this film as costing $1.8 million. when you compare it to something like primer, which did better with a budget of a few thousand, you realize in low budget film-making, it's all about the story. i wasn't expecting much - but i was still disappointed. two out of ten stars. This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers \"san pedro beach bums\".my wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a \"walk\". the end result was straight out of monty python's \"ministry of silly walks\" sketch. i couldn't laugh hard enough.and then there's the ubiquitous ms. banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). she has to be the most annoying self-important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left \"the view\". as if modeling was doing great things for mankind. please. i've never found her attractive, and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women. The film made no sense to me whatsoever. good actors(sergiocastellittoaparticular favourite; he was great in \"uomo dellestelle\"/\"thestarmaker\"but that was made by giuseppe tornatore, a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort),but awful, rambling script, terrible editing,and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say, and ended up saying exactly nothing. apretentious load of rubbish, but the sort of film that certain italianpseudo-intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it, and unfortunately italy has no monopoly on these, they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece. i never thought much of bellochio as director. i remember seeing his first film \"pugninella tasca\"/\"fists in the pocket\" (or some such title) in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago (i was living thereat the time). all the usual pseudos raved about it, but it left me pretty cold. i didn't think he was much of a director then, and still don't. age has certainly not improved him, and this film must rank as one of his worst. This is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense. the premise of the story, the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father,is very good. but the story just seems to beggar belief. whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it. it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing. On humphrey bogart's first trip to hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair. the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed. it's not half as good any of those films.in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton. it comes as quite a shock to mackaill. she considers a show business career as a way for an income.bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in bogey.considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair. the part doesn't wear well on him.love affair is your average b program second feature, nothing terribly special about it. Deniro is a master...one of my favourites. and i love good sports movies {not into baseball so much, but hey, its sports movies, right?. i was expecting much more for this movie. it seems to start out well: deniro is what i expected, snipes {whom i don't really like} is very good as the spoiled star. barkin's role, to me, was ok. she's a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. to me, they always seemed to rush the scenes, and then it drags a bit in places. it just seemed tio me to be so uneven! considering the cast and the plot, it could have been so much better. i rated it a '4', and i was being generous ~ i'm a tough one with numbers!. Has some really good music and performances; kid creole and the coconuts, james white and the blacks, dna, tuxedo moon, the plastics, melle mel, vincent gallo, lydia lunch...etc, but aside from this there isn't much more to it. the dialog, especially the narration(by saul williams), is actually pretty good, but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad, no matter how many hipsters are thrown in; debbie harry and jean micheal basquit(the latter being the leading role) both still don't have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item. it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity, but doesn't have the insight to keep it moving along, which is where the band performances come in. i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting, and i did enjoy it, but i just expected more. though it does have a fairy tale ending. Oh dear... as an englishman, and a small part welsh, a fan of anthony hopkins' work in the industry..... to date, i am truly disappointed. you see i am a nobody, who hoped for better. so my comments are as 'straw in the wind'. but, that's the point isn't it? - i have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work. i, a full member of the great unwashed, go to see a movie to be transported to another place. to yes, suspend belief for a brief period. but not to enter a state of total disbelief.had this been by an unknown author and director, i would guess that this 'production' would have been castigated into oblivion. unfortunately, its not, and i was left wide eyed and confused. having seen some of the rave reviews given this work i am faintly worried....perhaps its that i try, without prejudice, to view each movie on its own merits. regardless of author, director, studio or even the notoriety of the content.my advice, as many before me: don't write and direct the same production. it is fraught with danger. movies need to be moderated to retain a semblance of credibility.as they say in school reports \"could and can do better...\". Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. toshiharu ikeda, who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film, evil dead trap, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise.a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues.the staple of roman porno is sex. and sex mixed with violence. both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh. a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening (via condom) is too little kink to late.the series' rain motif continues and the film's final scene brings relief. A lot of alistair maclean's books have made it onto the big screen. some of them (the guns of navarone, fear is the key, where eagles dare) have been translated rather well; some (breakheart pass, ice station zebra, the secret ways) have been passable enough; a few (river of death, bear island, the way to dusty death) have been pretty rotten. caravan to vaccares is another movie based on one of maclean's perennially popular bestsellers, but alas this is yet another that deserves adding to the \"rotten\" list. peopled by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and escapades, caravan to vaccares is an absolute failure, both as a thriller and an entertainment. its only semi-redeeming qualities are: a) that it is filmed on very attractive provence locations, and: b) charlotte rampling looks utterly ravishing (with fully nude scenes to boot) as the main female character.disillusioned american drifter neil bowman (david birney) is travelling aimlessly through france when he meets british photographer lila (charlotte rampling). they decide to accompany each other, and during their wanderings make the acquaintance of mysterious nobleman duc de croyter (michel lonsdale). the duc persuades the pair to aid him in protecting and escorting hungarian scientist zuger (michael bryant), who is sought by various shady parties because of some information that he is carrying in his head. kept secret from bowman and lila is the fact that zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar power as cheap, economical energy. the hungarian needs desperately to get his formula to new york, but hired guns have been put on his trail to capture him  presumably so that he can be taken back to some ruthless criminal lord and tortured into revealing his priceless secret, which they can then sell on to the highest bidder. bowman and lila find themselves and their terrified fugitive on the run in the french countryside from their deadly adversaries.the film seems terribly cheap and amateurish, almost like an ultra low-budget independent film made by a non-professional cast and crew. yet a fair sum of money was actually thrown at the film, and all those involved have, at various points in their careers, done much better work. therefore, one has to assume that the film is bad simply because it has been written, acted and directed with a distinct lack of care and interest. the pacing is deadly slow, and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to put in too much unrewarded effort to keep up with the story. birney's performance is uninvolving, and rampling only creates a stir due to her nude scenes  the character itself is an absolute bore, and the actress looks rightly bored by it. for those who manage to stick with the film right to the very end, there is an unusual scene featuring some deadly rodeo clowns and a fierce bull (!) which, while not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different to the norm. caravan to vaccares is a very disappointing film in most respects, and once more a strong novel by the prolific author has suffered during its transition onto the screen. It's not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoeven's original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy, well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie. thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. after a decade of anti-sex aids-induced hysteria, a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked. all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. that it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. let's state the obvious for starters - sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell. what was so photogenic thru verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire michael caton-jones, who's flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. i like sharon stone a lot, but if the first film launched her career, bi2 could kill it. she has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt david morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. his dough-faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orange-skin machismo of michael douglas. supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché-heavy posturing. and what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? poorly-lit, fleetingly-glimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives - the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. don't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic. the film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of utter confusion, boring and laughable. the last 40 minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. as a failed sequel, basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic, beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2. as a vanity project, it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception. as a multi-million dollar piece of hollywood film-making, it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst. I just spent about 1.5 hours waiting for the movie to begin. it didn't. the story is vague and uninteresting, the speed in the movie is absent and the voiceover irritating. i can't understand why movies like this one are even distributed. I've tried to like this film, really. in watching it, all i can think is, \"this guy gives me the creeps, i would have gotten a restraining order\". it also calls out codependence in capital letters. was this really the conversation before making the movie? \"let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!\" from what i've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self-pity. the mood of the movie is distinctly 80-ish; brooding and slow. don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, just very few of them. The role of buddy ackerman is no stretch for kevin spacey. he's played version of that character many times other, better films. this is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce. the script leaves little time for plot or character development, resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the \"good stuff\". the difference is that here the \"good stuff\" isn't people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain, making it appropriate viewing for young adults.of course there's nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex, and i guess there's nothing wrong with \"swimming with sharks\" if you want to watch people undergoing physical, emotional, and psychological torture. but if you're looking for incisive satire, interesting characters, or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions, you should probably look elsewhere. The calu-what now? yeah, i thought it was a stupid name as well. chris carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff. starting off with the usual cheery x-files teaser (a baby getting run over by a train) this episode... well i can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill. poorly written, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the start) the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off, it's the worst technique ever. are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hate them? don't ask me. not only is it boring and un-scary, but it's like watching a really bad omen sequel with overblown and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects (although to be brutally honest, that's the least of my worries). sara b. charno began her x-files career with a whimper and thankfully ended it with one as well.verdict: in the words of my maths teacher mr. laverack: \"horrible, awful...\". Having low expectations going in, the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. i won't say the new footage was grade a material, but it provided a very solid foundation for what \"could have been\" a good all-original film.unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a time of one day shooting schedules. after the new footage, jules white decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'brideless groom' into this short, making for a not-so-smooth story transition, which jules and felix adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end, giving us the old, worn-out ending of the boys (moe & larry in this case) getting shot in the butt.3/10. Jason alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. the fact that he dances so well, croons so effectively, and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy. in his more cutesy moments (with the girl in the train station, in the final number with rosie), i couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent. you keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling. vanessa williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. by the way, if you see a production of the stage musical, the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie, you'll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical i've ever seen. The only thing good about this movie is the artwork on the promotion poster by h. r. geiger. anti-nuke protesters who all looked like punk rockers of the late 1970s, and somehow became non-violent, (except for their leader, \"splatter\") occupy the cities. fraternity boys descend on the punkers to do some violence on them and turn them into victims. bad acting and bad plot then descends on the real victim, you, the viewer. i gave this a \"2\" because a few sexual scenes at least give it mst3k potential. \"fat girls\" is among the worst films within the indie gay genre.the premise is promising: an average-looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small tx town. his only kindred spirits are the other village hs misfits: the class 'fat girl', a naïve immigrant from cuba, and the sensitive drama teacher. so far, interesting. in theory, this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built-in audience---the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across america and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand, peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humor.unfortunately, rather than a nuanced dramedy, ash christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. the result is a cast of unlikeable, derivative, two-dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward. sabrina (fink) is a quasi-goth bitter navel-gazer. she is such a prickly, unsympathetic person; there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition. the chemistry between her and rodney (christian) registers zero. this may have been bad casting, but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable. consequently, one is left wondering when there is such a non-existent bond, what could possibly warrant their near-constant companionship throughout the story.sabrina's newfound boyfriend, rudy (de jesus), and rodney's mother judy (theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films. rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant/nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent \"comedy\" ever made within the realm of tv or film. judy is the born-again obsessed with jesus- talk and big hair. just when you thought the tammy faye thing had been done to death, christian inserts a scene where judy's mascara is running with her tears! is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?in addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor, there are many puzzling story inconsistencies. rodney considers himself a \"fat ugly\" loser. however, he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock/hunk, ted (miller). although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment, most gay teens (filled with raging testosterone, just like their hetero brethren) would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy.rodney finds an object for his affection in bobby (bruening), an exotic transplant from england. against all believable odds, the lad not only happens to land in this tiny tx hamlet, but is conveniently openly gay to boot. like sabrina, bobby is an icy, angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head-scratching as to his magnetic appeal. much to his delight, rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar, where bobby claims to be the dj. upon arrival, the boyfriend-to-be promptly leaves rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man. this is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since rodney's feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town. as tiny as the town is, they have openly gay students at the high school? a secretly bisexual football captain? lesbian moms? a gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men, no less)? apparently, the place is not so backwater after all.ten years earlier, todd stephens' \"edge of seventeen\" covered nearly the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching, and humorous film. Do the writers that conjure up these type of \"comedies\" have such empty lives that they have to embody them in tragic shows like this?.why the talented and gorgeous busy phillips is amongst this trash is beyond me,i cannot stand the hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so unfunny and annoying as is the other african-american girl with the shrill voice.the jokes are often stupid, the jewish guy yells a lot and the show never goes anywhere, one particular episode with the solider looking for love was just terrible.i don't believe there would be that many working in a looking for love office and only one man? of course all of the woman are in tight fitting tops and tons of make up to make up for their lack of talent.i actually found holly funny in her older shows and i have always admired busy but this show is dumb, empty and had nothing going for it. Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (vargas). it looks very much like a tv movie, not really exciting. the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it. no real surprises here, though it is nice to see vargas. great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. the chase scenes are standard fare. This movie had a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow... very slow indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.the cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either. the sounds are ok. lighting ok.i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student.the movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid.no winnings here, skip this utter boredom. i've seen worse believe me, but this is just waste of time, and i don't get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings... I loathed this film. the original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. like many 70s horror flicks, it looked and felt like some creepy, unfinished documentary. phantasm ii, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained this nice attention to mood. sadly, phantasm iii is just awful. it tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films, which diminishes rather than expands their power. it shamelessly degrades imagery from the first phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original. there are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs. hundreds hang from the ceiling like christmas balls swaying in the draft. didn't anyone-- the prop master, the dp, the editor, the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy? even worse, phantasm iii presents one corny, unfunny joke after another. how different from the intensity of the first film. the original phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death. phantasm iii uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about reggie's horniness: several refer to the film's \"flying balls\" ha-ha, oh, i get it, balls. maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes, but they are on us. One would think that with the incredible backdrop of wwii stalingrad that the writers would come up with a script. nope. there is no story here! it's like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic, rote, and meaningless dialogue.a bunch of germans march around shooting and getting shot. slowly there are fewer germans to march around, shoot, and get shot. then there are no germans to march around, shoot, and get shot.pretty bad.chilcoot. Wow. the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists. i know a lot of those. the guys that'll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror. this \"movie\" is utter crap. it looks and sounds like a porno (good lord, the soundtrack is awful...), and has sub-par porn acting, which is shocking, because normally ron perlman is really a very good actor. i honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this. most likely \"beans, beans, beans..\" until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day... they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever, when they could have had a very interesting central theme (how do religious zealot anti-abortionists feel when it's the devil's baby?) but instead they chose to have ron perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed. it's just awful. like, plan 9 from outerspace awful. like, good god please would somebody turn it off before i soil myself awful. try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will implode. This movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what not to do. the original kicked some major tire squealing butt, this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of bruckheimer films, which is: we all know they suck, but they have great action. this film has no action. this film is boring. where are the cars? where are the chases? where's the tension? where's the suspense? where's the rush? where!!?? this isn't really a movie at all, it's a bad commercial. 50 cars in 24 hours? that is wrong. they have 3 days to steal them, the ad is wrong. how bad is that? the leads acting is stiff, wooden and forced. the villain, the cop, the others...who cares. they utter their pointless lines, they serve the illogical plot. they slog through it the best they can as the music video director says \"don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is\" or \"we'll fix it with lots of loud music\" the \"script\" isn't really a script at all, it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of: -------warning - possible spoiler------ 5------4-----3-----2-----1------ the fugitive. the biggest crime of all is the underuse of vinnie jones, man....this is the baddest, coolest mofo since jules in pulp fiction. and what do they do!? they make him a mute who's hardly in the film! make vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film. how could they have been so dumb? how? how? why? the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away. the original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers! go find the original. or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent ronin. the chases in ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged. bruckheimer and cage had all that money, all those resources, all that experience, and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for $250,000? how can that be? you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie. where i was once excited to see coyote ugly, remember the titans and pearl harbor, now i say: god help us all. Visually disjointed and full of itself, the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore-fest. the moments that work in this film are very limited, and the characters don't even feel real. how could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal? substantively and stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. jarring irregular camera work, awkward silences and gaps in action, and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen? whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. it added no meaning, just cheese, and didn't even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style, which is a close call). what a flop. A poor basketball movie. a gruff coach with a dubious background comes to a small indiana high school basketball team in the 1950's and coaches the boys to victory by \"breaking them down first, and then building them up.\"not a bad subject. photography ok. but the plot is totally predictable. no real sub-plots. nothing added to make the movie exciting. you know what is going to happen from the very beginning. suitable for 4th graders. A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. \"dressed to kill\" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. much of the acting (with the exception of young keith gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of de palma's own \"carrie\"--not to mention \"psycho\". the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock, not an homage. stylish in a steely cold way, the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from ****. Warning:i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.if you plan on watching this movie don't! i warn you... this movie is terribly boring and basically horrifying, not in the horror movie kind of way, to watch. i mistook this piranha movie for another piranha movie and when i had noticed i made a mistake i decided to watch this one anyway. i wish i wouldn't have. this movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that i couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent. for one thing, this movie should be called a boring talk about wilderness instead of piranha. they only show piranhas once! at the same time, the way this film sounds so poorly heard, i got sleepy only 20 minutes into the thing. at the end my mouth was hung wide open and i stared gloomily at the blank tv screen. it is a very poorly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that i was afraid i brain dysfunction after watching it... First, let me start off by saying this film sounded very interesting: a serial killer copycatting the works of edgar allan poe (who is one of my writers of all time). sounds cool, right? yeah, definitely not. probably the worst film i've ever seen. ever. and that's not an exaggeration. i've seen a lot of very, very bad movies. this one takes the cake. and i was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it.perhaps the writer should've studied some law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the killer, his entire life's history, a criminal record, and his address, where is the first place you should look? hmm. . . possibly. . . his house? what?! no! that's a preposterous idea, anthony! how could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley? *spoilers end* honestly, sometimes i can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find.i think my biggest pet peeve was how the police/fbi acted.for example: black fbi agent: \"okay, endangered female, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while i go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be. sound good to you?\" moronic female fbi agent: \"yeah, sounds a-okay to me. go right ahead. i'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter.\" black fbi agent: \"excellent, that's what i would do!\" honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you're a human and want to learn the same.0.5/10: a half-point just for getting a film produced and in stores. congrats.-ap3-. This feeble attempt at veering your typically bland japanese horror movie more towards a creepy cult hit did not have the ammunition needed to keep the viewer involved throughout. translated to vortex, uzumaki is about just that- an irrational and overabundant tribute to the strange downward spiral into nothingness that has seemingly captivated a whole small town into dementia obsessed lunatics. while this certainly makes for a pleasurable b-movie on the surface, the traditionally tiresome acting, direction, and script will have all but asian horror buffs shaking their heads in dismay. what could have roughly translated into japanese equivalent of an early david lynch piece, instead wares out it's spiraled gimmickry before it even has a chance to explain itself- which of course it does not. aside from a few clever techniques employed, the movie rarely connects the dizzying thematics with the dull script, ultimately coming across as a cheap exploitation into the cult genre, substituting hollow imagery for genuine substance. when the movie had ended there was hardly anything that was gained from any of the interactions, save a tiny few scenes or images that rose above the one note film. i do applaud the makers for at least trying to take the genre into more supernatural, metaphysical realms and understand the rough losses lost-in-translation, but with zero substance to back any of it's freakishness up this will likely be relegated to obscure fanboy's bong-ridden basements. For the record, i hate spoof movies. except for mel brooks and airplane! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés, not the actual movies itself. i think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. i especially hate things created by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer, the \"geniuses\" behind date movie, epic movie, and meet the spartans.i decided to give the comebacks a look. since friedberg and seltzer had nothing to do with the production, i was as objective as possible. it was just like one of their movies. it was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame kindergarten jokes, and disturbing images of bodily injury that's supposed to make me laugh and failed.only someone high would laugh at these jokes. toilet bowl? who wrote this? an 11 year old? i was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of wedding crashers, which was actually pretty decent. but there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning orphanage. the only reason that i gave this two stars (when it clearly deserved one) was because friedberg & seltzer had nothing to do with this. Don't bother. a little prosciutto could go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, particularly from dunaway. the plot is one of those bumper car episodes... the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again, until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot. gina phillips is actually good, but it's hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the marx's brother's duck soup. ah, the raven...now there's an actor. and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly. or dr. dread who's filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies. i'm one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end. quoth the raven, \"nevermore.\". This show is perhaps one of the most boring, most unfunny shows i've ever seen. while the humour was subtle, and i'm all for the subtle humour; the jokes just weren't funny.the show is about two kiwis in their mid-thirties living in new york trying to start their music careers.i saw the one episode where brett leaves the other kiwi behind during a mugging. okay, the plot idea has potential; but i got the feeling that half the episode was just filler, and the other half was actually important to the story.what i mean is, they kept on explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust for the other guy. i've got one piece of advice for the writers: mention it once for the idiots who can't figure it out by the way he's acting, and move on.and i found the characters were annoying. the character who left the other behind, brett, came across as being overly innocent and naive, the one left behind walked around talking in this monotone and robotic voice.a third character, who was the band manager, was obviously incompetent, but he was the one character that i liked. he's also the one that earned the show a one-star rating.all in all, a show i have no intention of ever watching again. Primal species (1996, dir. jonathan winfrey) international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs. the army commando team now have to think fast, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of the reptiles.you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film. that is pretty much it. the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters. the story is poor, with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. this film came out three years after 'jurassic park'. instead, this film looks to have come out 13 years before 'jurassic park'. the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made, and i do mean costumes. there are obviously people dressed up, and this film makes no attempts at hiding this. a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it looks like someone is riding the creature. the is one good thing, which comes out of this film. the short running time. at only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether.\"it's like a friday the 13th nightmare.\" - officer (brian currie). Sorry, but every time i see a film wherein a woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower, the film looses all credibility. so the new (female) starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended). dirk benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero-type than the new-age kattee sackhoff-- whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as \"a compelling, exciting, must-see, ground-breaking performance,\" by the politically correct new-speak of today's review copy editors; but in essence, it is just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse: the biggest cliché on screens today. i may give this series one more shot, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in. as james hilton once bemoaned, \"a story, please; just give me a story.\". I'd like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan (with a few notable exceptions), and i generally have a low opinion of so-called otakus, as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky-haired, big-eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors, such as the plot. and no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash, fatal fury: the motion picture. as seen through the glassy, witless eyes of an otaku, there's little to find fault with in fatal fury-- there's plenty of quirky japanese-y humor, one-on-one duels, some \"dramatic\" moments, and everything is beautifully drawn. but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched, predictable plot with cliched, predictable characters, culminating in a cliched, predictable ending. the love scenes are hilariously overblown-- the scene in which sulia \"heals\" terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment, but it's virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it. and of course, fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon t&a-- this is supplied gratuitously by the huge-breasted mai shiranui. and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name (oh boy), we're treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever (they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on, only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point). this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle, in which all the main characters engage the all-powerful main villain in one-on-one combat in turn. that's some thing that's always amused me... even when battles in animes aren't taking place in a tournament, they always happen as if they were, regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever! otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons, and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury. so would fatal fury have been good if it wasn't an anime? the answer is an emphatic \"no\"-- all of this movie's charm, what little of it there is, resides in the actual drawings. had fatal fury not been an anime, it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater 3000, if the show was still on the air. that's the key-- this is nothing more than a laughably bad b-movie in the guise of an anime epic. if you're a fan of movies so bad that they're actually entertaining, consider renting fatal fury (or catch it on the sci-fi channel), as it is definitely one of those. if you're an otaku, please wake up and realize that a good 90% of the stuff you're watching is garbage. as for everyone else, buy a dreamcast and fatal fury: mark of the wolves, but don't even consider seeing this movie. Looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex, this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer (or in this case director) geoffrey reeve.and it's a doozy. laughable on just about every level.some government agents (i think) are \"professionally murdered\" in amsterdam and a considerably less-than-charismatic, block-of-wood interpol agent (who i assure you is not named louis salinger) is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax-dodge financiers get their money's worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location.the wannabe-hard-hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid dried, but the script at least is very obliging in that it explains exactly what's happening regularly in horribly contrived direlogue (\"were you followed? oh no of course not. no one outside washington even knows you're here!\") yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing. by the time a sinister vladimir putin lookalike priest (no less than kronsteen from from russia with love) swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off, which is unfortunate because you'll miss our hero - pinned to the ground during a fight - struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol, and him shouting \"you bastaaaard!\" at his friend's murdered corpse, and the leather-bound, moustachioed go-go boys, the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which provide ample laughs. only the climactic boat chase impresses. it's an exciting, well-directed sequence that really has no place in this movie. such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - reeve had nothing to do with that sequence! thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous, spit-out-your-drink twist and warehouse shootout.unless such a wretched thing as a geoffrey reeve completist exists - and you're one of them - i wouldn't bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense. It's unfortunate that many of the other detractors of this film seem influenced by prior biases. (i.e. anger at the gay characters, thinking french thrillers are bad, etc.) i will admit that i'm unfamiliar with the novel, but as a film, after about 45 minutes, i was rolling my eyes. hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the 2 hours of its running length.(2 hours that felt like 3) don't get me wrong, i can sit through hour and a half silent films, 3 hour epics, i don't have a short attention span, nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film. here goes, my grocery list of complaints. first off, the ending. yes, it had a scooby-doo-esquire, character explains everything at the end. now i actually think for this movie, this was necessary.. the film had so many plot-twists, emotional revelations, new facts surfacing and being discovered.. one reviewer said it well: \"..yes, it is a very logical story, but without the very essential back story (their childhood stories, the relationship amongst the 3 parents, the relationship amongst the two lovebirds and the son of the big man), it just doesn't feel right. i felt cheated \" i won't throw in too many spoilers here, i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary, but according to the reviews on here, there's a lot of people who seem to really love this, so i don't want to give anything away. i personally, can't stand soap operas. the complexity, and twists and turns, for me, snuffed out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver. by the end, i seriously didn't care! there weren't any gaping plot holes necessarily; this seems like it could make a great book, in writing it is perfectly logical, but if i'm supposed to believe this is reality, something doesn't sit right with the pieces that have been haphazardly inserted. too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot, increase the emotion, and develop the mystery. the acting i had no complaints about, the directing, eh, not bad, but the plot, and especially its development, severely lacking. sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller, but i couldn't get into it. i gave this a 3 simply because i don't want to seem completely unfair, and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement. *major spoiler* and i have to mention it.. but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldn't fit in another twist.. \"your father didn't die in a hunting accident\".. i almost died.. when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story?!! are you serious!! like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasn't enough!!? does the protagonist need another emotional whallop more than he has already been fed?! sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler, but that just bothered me as much as i've ever been bothered in any film. Nu image, ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million.mr. hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750,000 if not considerably less than that. few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish.it's painful to watch. not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget.those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by p.t. barnum. After looking at monkeys (oops apes) for more than one hour, i was feeling like one too. i was an ape, spending money on this movie. please people, hold you money in your pocket and go see some funny movie like bridget jones's diary.. My grandad gave me this dvd. with friends like these. the front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it. what a bloody mistake.basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends.the first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. the second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge. and the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm.the dvd case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained. the film should be rated 12 for slight scares and the swear word bloody.all in all this film is utter shite don't go near it. Not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc, but easily the worst, never seeing the light of day. the director is not even canadian, but british, and boy does it show. we are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons. the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk. of course the british character is normal. the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say \"norm!!\"? the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes. the actors always seem to be fidgetting. are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the directors idea of cinema? avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films. a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes. Worst movie ever!! its not clever or funny or thought provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script.acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing.maybe the writer/director combination believed they were quentin tarantino or something (you know make a movie about nothing still cool) but failed miserably.i hope the writer never makes another movie ever!! not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever.please don't watch this movie, even on mute with the stereo going its still a painful 84 mins. I was expecting a lot from mr.amitabh bachan's role of sarkar, but am disappointed. being a ram gopal verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. there is a movie in tamil called nayakan based on the theme of god father and kamala hassan has played the lead. the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of kamala hassan, not his son. amitabh bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father. By far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull one over on us, as well as their dumb-witted marks, the cops, the mob and (ideally) each other. but this film never pulls this off. every scam can be seen coming a mile off (especially the biggen!) neither are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. perhaps mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships. if so, he failed. the lines are alright, but they're delivered in such a stilted, unnatural, stylised way that i thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time... but it wasn't. as for the psychological complexity, the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she's a whore, but she gets over it. i really liked the street scenes though. looked just like an edward hopper painting. If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10, this would be it. 'house of the dead' redefines the term \"bad movie\". other bad movies, such as 'when a stranger calls' or 'premonition', will actually look much better when compared to 'house of the dead'. the basic \"plot\" of house of the dead is a group of twenty-somethings travel to a remote island to attend the \"rave of the century\". when they get there, they only find some tents, a bar, a stage, and some bloody t-shirts. they decide to stay anyway, and they are soon attacked by zombies.there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. it is not entertaining. instead, it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. the acting is unbelievably bad. in a dvd interview, one of the actors claimed that uwe boll, the director, is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. this is a blatant lie. the script appears to have been written by an 11-year-old, who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line, \"it smells like someone farted out here.\" the characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. somewhere along the way, the characters also magically transform into a swat team to take down the zombies. it's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.the scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. there is something wrong with uwe boll. boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed. his pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. worse yet, boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the house of the dead video game into the movie. quite often, and at the most random times, you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. it makes no sense. no one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. it's like boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. uwe boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes, a la 'the matrix'. unfortunately, he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. the soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. this also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'house of the dead'.'house of the dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game. in fact, it has very little to do with the video game. it also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good'. it does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful'. this movie just plain sucks. uwe boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. even his presence will curse a production. to all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review, all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'house of the dead' and you will feel much better. i will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. to sum it up, words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. everyone involved in the production of this film, especially uwe boll, should be ashamed of themselves. although what i have said may make 'house of the dead' sound funny, it really isn't. nothing about it is funny. avoid this at all costs. Hybrid starts as water treatment planet security guard aaron scates (cory monteith) is involved in an accident which leaves him blind. luckily it just so happens that brilliant scientist dr. andrea hewitt (justine bateman) who works for olaris has developed an operation to transplant organs from one species to another, hewitt decides aaron would be perfect for her first human experiment. hewitt & her team transplant the eyes of a wolf into aaron & he miraculously regains his sight. brilliant, right? well, no not really since aaron starts to go mad as he sees random images of wolves & starts to develop a lust for blood. aaron escapes the olaris building & goes on the run but he is too valuable to just let go & a full scale search is mounted to capture him...directed by yelena lanskaya this is yet another sci-fi channel offering that is quite simply put terrible in every possible way, i think it probably started out life as a straight 'creature feature' but ended up as one of the most boring & dull sci-fi channel films i have seen that doesn't even feature any sort of monster or creature. hybrid is awful, the script is terrible & i am not even sure who it was meant to appeal to. the initial set-up is ok with aaron getting wolf eyes but then hybrid ditches the sci-fi elements & becomes some sort of horrible drama as it focuses entirely on aaron's mental state as he wonders around doing nothing in particular with some native american woman. yep, you don't think the sci-fi channel could make a film about wolves & put loads of rubbish about native american mythology in there as well do you? the dynamics of the character's is bizarre, aaron is shown as the persecuted hero yet he is the only character to kill anyone in the film & is a fairly unlikable, ungrateful & annoying person while dr. hewitt is shown as the evil scientist yet she gives aaron back his sight & does nothing but try to help him. i mean aaron is given back the gift of sight yet hewitt is the villain? also the regular sci-fi channel staple of us military intervention is present, the problem is why do they want aaron so badly? he isn't a soldier & while he has wolves eyes to help him see in the dark he's utterly unremarkable. the script can't make it's mind up whether it's all in aaron's mind or it's real, the ending is hilariously bad with a half naked (rememeber this was made for telly) aaron running through a forest with a pack of wolves set to some horrible music that i think is supposed to be emotional but makes it even more funny. there are so many things wrong with hybrid, it's slower than hell, there's virtually no action, there's no werewolves & the film goes round in circles trying to get into aaron's mind yet it's all so ridiculous, silly & boring you won't care one bit & there's never any explanation as to why despite just having wolves eyes transplanted aaron starts to develop other wolf senses.as a diabetic i have problems with my eyes, hell i have had major surgery on my right eye & i can guarantee you that after an operation your eye would be puffed up, you wouldn't be able to open it & it would hurt like hell yet despite having eye transplants as soon as aaron wakes up in bed his eyes are perfect with no swelling or even redness. there are no special effects, no blood or gore or violence & nothing to excite you. in fact now i think about it there's nothing even remotely horror or sci-fi feeling about this, it feels like a drab film of the week.filmed in manitoba in canada the film looks ok but is bland & forgettable. the acting is poor from all involved none of whom i have seen before & hopefully never again.hybrid is a terrible film that is obviously marketed as some werewolve 'creature feature' but is far from that & most people will really struggle to get to the awful ending which will probably have you in stitches. I know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. but the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open america's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government, and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. but somehow the documentary aspect of it, takes away from its drama. the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's.it would have been better to stick to a drama format. perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy. I go to ucsb and take some classes with the executive producer, alison anders. she's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on, i thought must be pretty good. this film as a selection at the santa barbara film festival seemed like a good choice.while this movie included some nice shots and cinematography, the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish. my main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell. bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground. the soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up. i just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film, it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good. Well.......in contrast to other comments previously written i have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like jason donavon which reminded me of my youth. i have no idea how it won any awards, and although i'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90's foreign soap operas. the plot was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a-level performance. it was unfortunately long and the sub-plots were incredibly unrealistic....for example....if your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends. it was all fantasy. that's all! oh yeah, and the weird 90's house/soft core indie was mind numbing!. I'll make this short and sweet....this movie sucked!!!!!!i watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever, gave it 9 out of 10 stars. so i thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels, i was wrong. this movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one, it had the plot continue and thats it. it was like bad outtakes from part one or something.i love walken, but i felt sorry for him here. i was so happy about glenn danzig being in this film, but don't blink you'll miss him. there was a full cast full of crappy actors and people i don't like such as eric roberts and jennifer beals. however, it was a breath of fresh air to see ethan embry, he's one of the funniest people on earth.this movie will make you like the first one a little less, so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself, being a fan of part 1. i am gonna wait a few days before i watch part 3 and i pray it is better than this crap.the last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film. fast forward or skip to that if you can't stomach the first part.1 out of 10 stars - this was awful!. Okay, what the hell kind of trash have i been watching now? \"the witches' mountain\" has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet, at the same time, it's also strangely compelling. there's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and i even doubt there ever was a script to work with, but somehow i couldn't turn it off. the scratching your head with confusion starts right away, with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat. so you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces? heck no, because after this intro, the girl and her wickedness simply aren't mentioned anymore. then cut to a guy, with the most impressively trimmed mustache you'll ever see, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way. when she asks him to spend his vacation with her, he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment! great move. the movie finally starts now, as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks. though not before he picks up a new girl (patty shepard) and photographs her topless! throughout their journey, all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained. the girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! really, car jacking witches? apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers. that's as close as i get describing the plot, but there's a good chance i'm way off more important here is the atmosphere! \"the witches' mountain\" is occasionally very creepy, with its spooky music and interesting cinematography. the supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing patty shepard plays a good heroine. this is the type of european horror film that could have been legendary, if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay. Wow, this is very unusual in one regard: usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch. people are surprised when a sequel is actually better. with tarzan, i thought this movie was the worst of the bunch, or at least the first six which comprise my tarzan collection dvd package. i will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but i am through sitting through this turkey, thanks to several characters.well, let's start with the good news first:the good - plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if they are just stock footage. you see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called \"dwarfs\" in the movie.) since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, i can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago. they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds. however, weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. he and o'sullivan make a well-built handsome couple, if there ever was one in those golden years of cinema.the film has historical value (with so many sequels) in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his beginnings of learning the english language.the bad - from the moment \"jane parker\" is taken by tarzan almost every scene with her is maureen o'sullivan in hysterics, shrieking and screaming scene after scene. it's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film. thankfully, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. the movie also does no favors for \"the great white hunter\" image as c. aubrey smith, playing jane's father, and neil hamilton, as \"harry holt,\" the safari guide, shoot at every animal within sight, whether the beasts is threatening or not. these people are kill- happy, particularly smith. on another note, it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place. there is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up. he's just there when jane and the group get to a certain point in africa. When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr. coulomb, fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case. as the deaths continue to mount, mr. martin obviously isn't having much success. by the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which i won't reveal here.one of the other users commenting on this states \"this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart\". i'm sorry but i have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. it is \"classic\" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality. i've enjoyed a lot of low budget \"b\" movies from around this time period, but this isn't one of them.the pacing is unbearably slow, the camera work is pretty bland, most of the acting is fairly wooden (even lugosi isn't great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, while it has an interesting premise, seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner. ...and it is this film. i imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is probably the worst film i have ever seen next to \"manos, the hands of fate\"... and i have seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. this is just a crummy b movie, bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) the thing i really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the \"heroes\" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! to be fair, crown international really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing. but honestly, this was probably a bad film to begin with, so crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it. this really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. i wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy. actually, it's my kind of campy b movie. it was bad, but i still liked it, despite my one star rating. First off i am in my mid 40's. been watchin horror films since i was a kid so i have seen a lot of variety. imo,this is not as bad as the multitudes that gave this a 1 or 2. yes,it is a low budget horror flick. the dialog is soso and acting tolerable,sometimes. the basis of this film plotwise is actually pretty good. for those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on dvd. this is very much like a 1970's movie of the week. just add in blood and minor gore,minor t & a and swearing, without big names. that is it to a t. i would rather watch this than jason vs godzilla or whatever other continuois crap is out there. tho not as good, evil dead was a low budget film. at least give these guys credit for trying. with acouple mil budget this could have been a pretty good flick. my score a watchable 4. I´m only joking. this was potentially the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to sit through. how anybody in the 1950´s could have raised a laugh at this innane rubbish is beyond my comprehension. i jest not. Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. if you can even call it a film. this looks like some first-year art school project, hastily cobbled together.the \"talents\" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious.the film in no way reflects malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here. i live in malaysia, btw.spinning gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival. and unfortunately, that ploy seems to have worked. some reviewers would no doubt describe it as \"exotic\", but a more accurate word would be \"atrocious\". Really, average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this.the acting was average (maybe a bit above average), the camera usage was average (actually below average. the picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry.) the plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use.this could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds.all we see are flashbacks here and there of alice and how her home life is so \"bad\" (her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter.) we see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her \"tell your mom to make some better food\" and \"everybody says it's your mom.\" yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. i could definitely see if her mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it. how immature! we're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like (except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman, forgot her name, gave her baby up when it was 9 months old.) this really could've been so much more. it could've had alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute. or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie (that is) alice, a girl with a home life of probably 90% of america's population (working class) runaways to florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.i don't see why it won an award at sundance (it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award.) also to me, alice's boston/new england accent seemed forced. it didn't seem genuine. (i should know, i was born and raised in boston, but now live in georgia.) 4/10 not really worth your time in my opinion. Is this supposed to be serious? i hope not. this is one of the most pathetically hilarious movies i've ever seen. given that i picked it up for a buck on the \"bad movies\" shelf, it sure lives up to its spot in the shop. what can i say, the gore effects are spattered (pun-intended) all over the place, some looking quite real, some looking like a teddy bear that's had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. the music is some of the most horrible i've heard, the acting is one of the most amusing elements... must i continue? don't bother unless you've seen every other pathetic horror movie in the shop and this is all that's left. Well, first off, if you're checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead (1968)-type film, forget it. this is about \"zombies\" in a more psychological sense, where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will, but who must instead follow the will of another. the \"zombies\" here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general, as in wartime. it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film.the film is set during world war i. a \"french cambodian\" contingent had heard strange stories about zombification--supposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombies--and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes. armand louque (dean jagger) brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but he won't talk. so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to \"wipe out the white race\".one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer/director victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. the film begins as if it will explore the zombie/military metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes, it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story.halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power (and a nietzschean \"will to power\"). the film is interesting on that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. this is yet another older film for which i wouldn't be surprised if there is missing footage, especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue.amidst the contrived romance story, halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little of the zombie material makes much sense. louque discovers the secret of zombification, but it doesn't mean much to the viewer. the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusinghalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of bela lugosi's googly-eyes from his 1932 film, white zombie, but never explains what it has to do with anything. there are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. promising, interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time. one potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much.if you're a big fan of old, creaky b movies, revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least once--the acting isn't all that bad, and if you've got a good imagination, you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps. but this is the second time i've seen the film, with the first only being about five years ago, and i could barely recall anything about it--so it's not exactly memorable. Debra winger's 1987 \"black widow\" is much better.this is like a lame version, and jane seymour usually does better.chad allen is pretty poor in this too. just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child.maybe the both of them being from dr. quinn was supposed to make us get excited.if it's on, go grab a copy of \"black widow\". This is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen.the only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous lydie denier in some of the scenes.despite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every aspect,her nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hell.anyway about the movie,well nothing really interesting to say,a neonazi and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30-40 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol.while the gangs fight over berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town.armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes.the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie.the killing of the children,the involvement of the underworld,the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the \"trial\" of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie.the acting is terrible,the script just stupid,the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money.don't even bother renting this one. I know john singleton's a smart guy 'coz he made boyz n the hood, so how did he write and direct this? it's like the pilot of a bad \"going away to college for the first time\" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition, i guess. who would've guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood? the angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neo-nazis (and would be roomed-up with a black and a jew - just for laughs!) even laurence fishburne's creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. except busta rhymes, of course. big ups. It's like what other dracula movies always do, the minions of dracula always on dracula's side, which is what disappointed me at the ending. regardless the person wants to stay a vampire or not, i would like to see something like in the first movie that the minion fights against her master. it is much interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just either the priest or d. win the game (we need some surprising plots!). This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes. the pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece, even better than say gosford park. then it inexplicably slows down, loses focus and starts resembling a traditional french movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between antoine (depardieu) and cécile (deneuve). in the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story, several threads started are not ended.*******spoilers ahead the main story is the relation between antoine and cécile. he has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago, despite her remarrying and setting up home in morocco. as builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of cécile's marriage. having accomplished this, he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. he wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together. *******end of spoilersit remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here: illegal immigrants want to enter europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of iraq's former regime. cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend, whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?). her sister is traditional islamic, and enters a relation with cécile's husband. it portrays morocco as unnecessary backward, despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past. it portrays islam as backward and prone to extremism, which may sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. in the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art.deneuve and depardieu are great. with this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene: lifting an eyebrow, body language, radiating pride, awkward behavior. the movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of french cinema in the world nowadays. with some notable exceptions of course. I am sorry folks, but i have to say i really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...when i saw it i looked at my watch to know how much more time i had to spend with this kindergarten nonsense.so why this verdict?first of all: the movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! it is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a quentin tarantino we used to know. this story could have come out of every little kid's head. it doesn't have anything intelligent in it, neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. the rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. doesn't work. even the previously seen cutbacks that tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. second: some guys go to germany and kill nazis. ah really? do they? the only nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. is this the ugly face tarantino wanted to give the nazis? a brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the \"basterds\"? certainly not --> fail and what happens to the terrible nazi-killing basterds? well they all get killed by nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are...third: any characters? yes one! the only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is chritoph waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. great acting! brad pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by waltz. never seen a such a weak performance by pitt... and the rest? well, some germans you've never seen before and will never see after. when the movie started and i saw the group of the seven basterds i hoped to see something like the \"magnificent seven\": a group of extraordinary guys, each one with a distinct character, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... i was then very disappointed, when i saw the \"inglourious basterds\". no details at all, no characters, no real men, just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... but in fact you don't even need to differentiate, cause the \"inglourious basterds\" except pitt hardly play any role in this movie...so i was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened... Did anyone edit this film? or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? it's ok though, i fell asleep watching it the first time. then i fell asleep the second time and the third time. the plot is actually not the worst i've seen, but it's close. the acting is not the worst i've seen either...but it's close. the production .... well, i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life! not trying to be spiteful, but unhinged could have used some more production.please don't think i'm a hater of horror films, or even that i didn't enjoy this film. i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it. the gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget.characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending was pretty bad, and the exposition took forever without exposing much.i'd recommend avoiding this movie.1/10. Well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for pre wwii italy. but what happened here? great actors...kristin scott thomas, sean penn, anne bancroft, james fox, derek jacobi ...if you can't get memorable performances out of this `a list' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. i rented this on dvd after having liked \"angels & insects\" (1995) also directed by philip haas. yipes! i can hardly believe how dull this thing was. it just dragged on and on and no one was able to save the poor thing. this is not even a good intriguing-foreign-dudes-and-young-things-in- pretty-clothes chick flick!\"tea with mussolini\" gone amuck!. I am a fifth grade language arts teacher, and after we read this book (which the students loved), then we watched the movie. they laughed out loud! unfortunately, it's not a comedy! the acting was so awful, i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play. my students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through. i have to agree with them, at times, it was pretty bad. still, i would show it to students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. we did a venn diagram (teachers know what that is) afterward, to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. i noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better!. The last reviewer was very generous. i quiet like the first movie, but can't say i enjoy this one very much. the beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill pretty quickly. i just don't see jon bon jovi as a \"bad-ass vampire hunter\" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. a lot of the scenes just do not make sense. i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. why una is able to communicate with jovi? nothing was ever explain in this movie, you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining, but that was too much to ask. this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen. This movie is a disaster within a disaster film. it is full of great action scenes, which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality. let's see, word to the wise, lava burns you; steam burns you. you can't stand next to lava. diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film. i mean the acting is actually very good. the effects are above average. hard to believe somebody read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted. i guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on tv ... look away! it is like a train wreck: it is so awful that once you know what is coming, you just have to watch. look away and spend your time on more meaningful content. I really wanted to love this film. i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. the book is marvelous. this film is very far from the book. the book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation.in the book, sara is honorable, kind, strong, and never does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. that's the point of the book! she behaves as a \"princes\" regardless of circumstances. an important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. it is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.in the book, she endures much and touches the lives of others. other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. sara does what is right simply because it is right.outside of the bakery, she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. she has half a dozen hot buns. she is very hungry. she gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. when she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun, she gives her another. she continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 i think - i don't remember how many.the baker is watching through the window. she is so moved by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. other people are similarly influenced by sara.and in the book, her father has died. the man next door is her father's partner - he has been looking for her. her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find sara; he takes her and becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. and sara has her full inheritance, of course.miss minchin is not a chimney sweep. in fact, she remains in her same post at the school. but she is humiliated as sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. and sara does speak to miss minchin in the end - miss minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of sara and sara with a calm steadfast demeanor, instructs miss minchin that she had been cruel.there is no comeuppance for miss minchin. she continues on in her miserable existence. it does not matter - what matters is that sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, becky, is now for all intents and purposes, her sister.the book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. it is about self control and humility. it is a wonderful book. this film does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book. my wife was so disgusted with it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. we were not rewarded.i cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that shirley temple acted in. i don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that i do not recognize it.don't waste your time - buy the book. it is unforgettable... even for a dad!. This movie was ok, as far as movies go. it could have been made as a crossover into secular movies. however, it had little to do with the left behind books that it was supposedly based on. major story premises were removed, and new major story premises were added. what disappointed me most was how nicolae was portrayed. he was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this point in the books. antichrist is not satan, is not omniscient and not omnipotent. faith and beliefs were portrayed in weird, surreal ways that seemed to make the movie just silly.non-believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock christian beliefs. It's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting. there's some good work here.unfortunately they suffer from what afflicts much of modern gay cinema; recycled plots, too familiar devices (i have seen the \"pool\" setting way too many times in gay male films) and hackneyed scripts. most egregious of all is \"dorothy\" whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a shortage of identifiable availabe gay guys in his vicinity.in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay afterschool specials. not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution; basically they follow a point-and-shoot, shot/reaction shot/master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes. there's hope for queer cinema in the works of todd haynes, sadie benning and the late, great marlon riggs...but not here. these films are incredibly middlebrow, singularly whitebread and their values basically pander to a gay bourgeois sensibility. which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals. Fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. he considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. this is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than \"barry lyndon\"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest, and has its genuine absorbing moments. it's a difficult film to find (only \"unofficial\" copies are in circulation), though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video. recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts. As a huge fan of horror films, especially j-horror and also gore i thought nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good. i researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it. so excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed. the plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much unexplained, the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying, and what was with the cartoon style sound effects ? the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it. i did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light, they left both pretty unexplained, or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldn't understand what i was actually seeing. i appreciate the way it was supposed to be; shocking and a few scenes (the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing?)certainly were, i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way, they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. however it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends, but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value, but don't be expecting a dark, deeply scary and horrifying film; you'll just be disappointed. if this was a horror comedy/spoof i'd probably rate it about a nine, the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife's stomach and closed up her wounds, but as a horror sadly i gave it a one. I must tell you right up front, i am certainly not an authority on bollywood films and have only seen a handful. however, if you've never seen one, don't start with this one! i have greatly enjoyed the ones i've seen up until this one, but i just couldn't stand this one. i also must tell you up front that i could not finish this film--it was that annoying. so why was it so annoying? 1. there is a character named 'rambha' in the film. he is even more annoying than jar-jar binks--which i never would have believed would have been possible. he is so #@^!# annoying!! he spoke in a falsetto voice and i think was meant to be comic relief. instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly! his voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness--he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in--and he needed to die! 2. the heroes had the amazing ability to dodge ak-47 bullets with ease. i kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!! and, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet and beat up the ruffians!!! this made stallone's actions in \"rambo ii\" look mundane!! 3. the film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense--it practically made my brain bleed!! it was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!! crazy camera angles, intense music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.4. the two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever! perhaps if you are the most ardent action and bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me i can see why it's on imdb's infamous bottom 100 list. wow...this film is bad and intensely bad!!. There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie's trailer. i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies, but i can't help but support the backlash against this movie. it is slow, boring and bordering on pointless. even the \"almost nice and believable moments\" were immediately undercut by painful clichés and bad acting. vernetta lopez and wong li lin, whom i usually love, were only passable in this movie. it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap, then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. the leap years should come with an ra rating (rated awful) but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies. more good films will come, so long as more films like these don't get made. Richard dix is a big, not very nice industrialist, who has nearly worked himself to death. if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? well, he'll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler.this william castle directed entry has some great moments (the introduction and the depiction of richard dix's life through newsreel a la citizen kane), and some intriguing plotting in the final reels. dix's performance is generally pretty good. but, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.this is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role. What is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it? carlos mencia is no george lopez. there is a difference. when watching comedian carlos mencia, i think he hates his own people. and more than that, i think he was forced to pattern his show as the \"hispanic/latino/spanish\" version of the dave chappelle show. what a horrible mistake. (note to mencia: please do not do a \"block party\" movie. as much as i would like to see santana, tierra, el chicano, christina agullaria, jennifer lopez, shakira and the reunion of the cast of \"xica da silva\" on one stage, don't.) carlos mencia likes to use the word \"beaners\" as much as dave chappelle liked using the \"n\" word. neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it's from 'their own people'. carols mencia also likes to say, \"if you're offended, too bad\". it's not the offense, it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.carols mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. it's not comedy, it's not funny. there is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning.mind of mencia needs polishing because carlos mencia needs polishing. find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. until then, the show, mind of mencia is a pass. Wimpy stuffed shirt armand louque (blandly played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. armand falls for the lovely claire duval (fetching blonde dorothy stone), who uses the meek sap to get armand's colleague clifford grayson (the hopelessly wooden robert noland) to marry her. furious over being used and spurned by claire, armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. sound exciting? well, it sure ain't. for starters, victor halperin's static (non)direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace. worse yet, halperin crucially fails to bring any tension, atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings. the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any; only george cleveland as the hearty general duval and e. alyn warren as the irascible dr. trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. the drippy stock film library score, the painfully obvious stagebound sets, and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. in fact, this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom. a dismally dull dud. I should love this movie . the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap .the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy . barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family . i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it.again the acting was very very good and worth watching . i really don't like the story line . just a personal preference .thank you. This thing was bad. really bad. i mean, low budget can sometimes be very inspiring, but not this. the story was so off-the-shelf, the alien's behaviour so illogical, the characters so clichéed. i found nothing good in it. and i did try. Well since seeing part's 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4. everything from the tacky, and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting, i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds.i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion, but without him around in this one it's just not the same. sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story line's, but it was a good closure at the end of the third one. again there was no reason for a part 4. even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh*t i had to sit through, lol. there goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again. This film tries hard but fails. perhaps to non-australian audiences it may have appeal as a travelogue, but to the native it is merely tedious.anyone who lives here knows broken hill is a rough, tough isolated mining town. if a couple of citified fruits turn up in drag, well it's all so predictable. where have i come across that well-worn theme before? oh yes -- town mouse and country mouse. spare us.i kept hoping it would improve but after the broken hill scene i could see where this was heading and so turned off the tv and went to bed. This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. i wouldn't call it a movie, it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories, which are not all that funny. there're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. he's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1/2 hours. i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy.i think this movie is just an extended version of \"hitch\", padded with a lot more characters and dancing.if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made, then i'm pretty sure i'm not interested in any of his previous ones. This is a lame comedy.here's why: a man and wife sitcom. okay.the husband is a douche bag. the wife is the einstein.how original is that? jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld.the gags are lame. no witty one-liners.i have had enough. stop this now.the last word: stupid. the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc. the worst part? kevin james is actually a funny comedian. he just isn't here. leah remini is great eye candy, but is unlikeable. wasted talent is the word. bad sitcom. I think i will make a movie next weekend. oh wait, i'm working..oh i'm sure i can fit it in. it looks like whoever made this film fit it in. i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!! it looks like someones home movie and i don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!! total crap!!! who let's this stuff be released?!?!?!. I'm a big fan of the first critters movie. the second episode is good,but it's not as good as the first critters. the third episode is a little bit boring,but lovely. and what is this?? what a crap! it's stupid and really,really boring. it's the worst of the series. i can't watch it again,because i felt asleep at the first watch. and ug's evil side...eeewww...that's one of the most horribble moments of the movie. in the first 50 minutes,we can't see the little,furry monsters,that's the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie.it could have been much better.2/10. There was a time when michael jackson was revered as the king of pop. then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as lemonade attracts wasps. finally, it is now the time that we feel truly sorry for this man.this 'movie' is another reason to. i promised a rabid michael jackson fan to watch it with her. you know the type of fan -- someone who tells him- or herself to like everything the object of affection ever did. while watching this movie, which she had seen twice already, i realized how far this fandom goes. probably far enough to rate this movie above a 1/10, as some people miraculously did.the movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series, most notably cast away, lost and jurassic park. unfortunately, it fails miserably at any level. the acting does not save the absolutely horrible story, the filming has the quality of a too-often played video tape, the special effects were better executed in be kind rewind (for those who do not now this movie: with aluminum foil)... all this would be funny if the movie managed to be, well, funny. unfortunately, it is not. it hurts to watch this.and then there is michael jacksons appearance in this garbage. he appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message, and manages to come across as mobile as jabba the hutt and as serious as a 4-year old. just when i thought \"who is the terrible person that lured this poor man into participating in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself\", i (finally) reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at jackson's neverland ranch. in other words: he. likes. it.this movie, and jackson's involvement in it, is truly disturbing. do not watch it even for the \"haha, a movie in the imdb bottom 100\" effect. or be warned. It seems incredible that the same decade which brought star wars to the silvery screen disgorged such unutterable tripe as this and many other 'adventure' movies. i am reminded of the similarly lavish, but equally wretched 'ashanti' outlined elsewhere.whatever motivated a-list actors to sign-on for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer. they must have been very, very desperate. to be perfectly candid, roger moore's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death. although extremely handsome in his youth, his entire acting career has been predicated upon an ability to raise one eyebrow. every emotion from a to b is conveyed by this simple stratagem. his were the dog-days of james bond. lee marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy outings, perhaps most memorably 'paint your wagon' and 'the dirty dozen'. he has a comic streak, but he is much better when he plays it straight.the excellent ian holm is a throwaway, hardly recognisable blacked-up as a mute african. everyone else just turned up for their pay-cheques.the only plausible and watchable element is the german cruiser. it looks like a very large model. but it is believably massive and appears authentic - as do its crew. the rest isn't even hokum. the childish comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that meanders clumsily about, as if the script itself had had too many whiffs of lee marvin's gin. here is a director who simply doesn't know where he's going. there are hints of 'the african queen', a snatch from 'the pride & the passion', 'gold', and one or two other rip-offs from movies who's titles don't come readily to mind.strangely, i have seen it 3 times, each occasion it has been shown on television when i have been laid low with a cold or the flu. perhaps that is influencing my judgement - but not much.compare it with any indiana jones movie and you will see what i mean.i have given it two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end, though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that.time for another lemsip, i think. Ok, so i saw this movie at this year's sundance, and i was sorely unimpressed. it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham-fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close-up of ryan gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. after the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watch-able albeit not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. the highlights certainly include both gosling and morse's acting, gosling being an up-and-coming star, and morse being an extremely well-established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. as a sidenote, after the screening i was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind me--he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2\" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject. Sorry fulci fans, but i could not get through this one. the soundtrack was about as annoying as they come, the acting was puerile, the story has been done and done, and the direction was non-existent. massacre honestly looked like a children's film project. but i've seen some of those, and they actually look better than this did! it appears to have been so underfunded they couldn't afford ... anything! not a dop, not a director, no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was. it was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst.this was about the worst suck-fest i've seen, next to terror toons which is second only to killer klowns from outer space. i've nothing else to say about it.it rates a 0.1/10 from...the fiend :. Yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies, but i have definately seen worse. think gremlins rated r. well anyway, i met rick sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! it was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in).he seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the mst3k version!all in all, rick sloane knew what he was doing. and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks. so i guess i'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow msties. sorry guys. Altman's quintet has to be considered more than just flawed: as so many other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices in depicting those ideas, ought to work--and yet very little in this difficult film does. the partially fogged camera lens--i remarked to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial conceit i've ever seen--never allowed me to get \"into\" the film's world.in general there are serious problems with the mise-en-scene employed here. it's clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design, but neither is very effective in evoking a believable world. perhaps it is a matter of scale; the film is so stage-bound that i laughed out loud once it was mentioned that \"five million\" people lived in the city. (yes i understand the constraints of the film's budget. matte paintings here and there might have helped.) in all the most disappointing altman film i've ever seen. great ideas and grand metaphors do not always come through in art--it's just part of the game. Dear richard, i know we all loved you on home improvement with tim allen. but seriously, do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to air bud? i would have thought tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant. i know that seems ironic, but the pay benefits are much more rewarding.everybody would see you around tim and instantly think \"tool time\". you would even get roles with bob vila more often. instead, you appear for 10 minutes with a golden retriever and smiling. i know there wasn't much of a script, but you could have added to it. i mean, come on. tim owes you one.but seriously, this movie does nothing for the air bud line. quite the contrary, the fake talking puppies are cornier than actually seeing the dogs play sports. the original was better. and you, mr. richard karn, know that more than anybody.this is an \"f\" movie. I have read all of the love come softly books. knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. i was highly disappointed in this movie. the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). that is all. the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that i just couldn't enjoy it. even if i didn't read the book it was too sad. i do know that pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great. This is a rotten movie.the cast seem to know just how bad it was.it starts badly and by the end is truly bad.the acting is woeful.the script could of been written on the spot.and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes.crap 1 out of 10. This movie attempted to make stu ungar's life interesting by being creative. what they forgot is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it's own without having to make things up.a short list of the inaccuracies: 1) stuey was not sent straight to las vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts, he spent a good deal of time in florida first, and only went to las vegas when he ran out of gin games on the east coast.2) stuey never associated (or played gin) with a casino executive (like the one played by pat morita in the movie.) 3) there was no magical turnaround in the buildup to the 1997 wsop. in fact stuey barely made it into the tournament as it was. he snorted cocaine the week before even.either tell the story right, or don't tell it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for michael imperolli's credible performance (the only redeeming quality of this movie.). The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring. some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor.there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script. lena endre was good looking as always.i don't remember the original movie so i can't say if it's better or worse.if you enjoy movies like sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at. Totally forgettable and almost unwatchable. if you enjoy bad acting, thin plots and predictably weak outcomes, pull up a chair. of passing interest to see bridget fonda look-a-like suzy amis. Unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from kerry conran, for whom this is clearly a labour of love. unfortunately it's just not that good. it all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score, a mixture of lucas and hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a spielberg. the movie also references many pulp sci-fi novels, serials and films as diverse as the day the earth stood still, superman, metropolis, planet of the apes, the iron giant, star wars and the spy who loved me. the film however, fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons: the main being that it's such a labour of love, so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world, conran actually forgets about making a movie. there is little to no tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles, dinosaurs and race-against-time set-pieces. even the noir elements fall flat. this is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green-screen just looks like a video game half the time and it's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards. the actors don't get to do much either - jude law is wooden, gwyneth paltrow is annoying and stupid, angelina jolie is wasted - and it's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything. it is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday. nice ending though. I just finished \"dark chamber\" aka \"under surveillance\" and i'm stunned. stunned, not by the film, but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it. the story was so ravaged by plot-holes and the majority of the acting so flat, categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate. seriously, i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie.justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer-addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom's warnings that dad is no good. when a young woman is found murdered, justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments. with the help of a couple pals, he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks. as the truth begins to unravel, justin uncovers an unexpected secret.one positive point is that felissa rose is hot! i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit, but no such luck. it would have been the film's potential saving grace. eric conley played justin very adeptly, i thought, and i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future. the general premise of the film, although plagued by clichés, might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow \"performances\" of key cast members, most notably alexandra eitel (kayla) and david h. rigg (justin's father). the horror! (pardon the pun).i have nothing against low-budget films. indeed, i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come. i'll cut low-budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical score and the overall picture quality. i don't give allowances, however, for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover's script. there are a vast number of competently-made low budget films out there. sadly, this isn't one of them. i can't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised \"dark chamber\" here are in some way affiliated with its production. Bonjour tristesse covers similar ground as 'the member of the wedding.' to wit, a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper. while critics love 'member of the wedding,' i find julie harris to be a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, scenery-chomping thespian in everything she's been in. this portrays irritating, rich idiots as in last year at marienbad, but this time it's a travelogue.in this preminger movie sequences develop, but characters do not. for the first 30 minutes he's content to blur the father-daughter relationship between seberg and niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. once the conflict is introduced, seberg can't deliver the depth the part requires. kerr pulls rank and turns the film into 'endless love.' seberg's vacuous narration, is like something out of strange interlude - it is not good. i really wish someone other than niven was in his role. he spends so much time normalizing orthodox british behavior in all his movies, he never gets around to the character.in the most memorable sequence, an evening out dancing becomes a free-for-all in a harbor. bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, 'the conformist.' kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain (as in black narcissus, night of the iguana, king and i, heaven knows mr. allyson, tea and sympathy, etc. etc.). really, kerr was a horrible actress. i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash, or even better, start with one.people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this. The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie. absolute lowest common denominator humor. painful viewing. a complete chore. written no doubt in less than a week, just like the first one. give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell. and don't let him out until he's developed a decent script for something, anything. he has it in him. these austin powers things are just embarrassing. let goldmember sink without trace. I read the comment of chris_m_grant from united states.he wrote : \" a fantastic documentary of 1924. this early 20th century geography of today's iraq was powerful.\"i would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran, the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass, a nation's battle for life. these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures. i am from this region of iran myself. i am a bakhtiari. chris, i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment. iran and irak are two different and distinct countries. taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican. thanks,ziba. Teenage exorcist is one of those god-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. her sister and brother-in-law, along with an irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. well, not much here in way of horror or suspense. in fact, one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect. mike(the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her(the name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens) up after trying to chainsaw her sister. he removes a gag from her mouth and says something like, \"this won't be the last gag we see tonight.\" indeed, it was not. the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal. some of the lines and situations are funny. robert quarry, old count yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an irish priest. he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs. you know you are in trouble, however, when eddie deezen gets top billing. deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well, but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler. michael berryman, from the hills have eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film. as for the other thespians, well, they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and french-cut panties, but beyond that don't expect too much more from her. her sister is played by elena sahagun, and she shows a bit more than brinke(a very lovely young lady by the way) and out acts brinke by miles. her husband, played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. again, not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on. if you are a robert quarry fan, watch it for his performance at the very least. Seriously, i don't understand how justin long is becoming increasingly popular. he either has the best agent in hollywood, or recently sold his soul to satan. he is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing. the only film that he has attempted to anchor that i've remotely enjoyed was waiting... and that is almost solely because i've worked in a restaurant. but i digress. aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits. i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the pg-13 rating certainly won't allow. the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim). his one liners were funny on occasion, but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. if you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you'd enjoy this, but i can't recommend it at all. ...cause they're both pretty lousy. i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs. she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture, rip someone to bloody pieces, and calmly re-enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened. now, you know a movie's in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention.i admit, i paid $30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie. i know what you're thinking--30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole. and you would be absolutely correct. this movie sucks. there, it's right out in the open. i was expecting some actual scares, and i waited and waited and waited. none came. the raven (probably a crow in makeup) didn't scare me, seeing small pieces of internal organs didn't scare me, and even faye didn't scare me. i'm not that brave, i know, so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble. what's more, jennifer wasn't scared either. her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything. her life was rapidly coming to a close and she's worried about attaining more money. honey, you can't take money where you're going!!! \"i need money,\" she continually says, completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function.meanwhile, i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother (faye). i was suspicious at first, faye playing a grandmother and all, and i was still suspicious at the end. there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother-from-hell are forced to share temporarily, and i'm guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother. here's the weird part--the relative looks like she's just endured her eight hundredth birthday party. mary ellen looks like she's just gotten a face-lift from a renowned surgeon. face-lifts can't work miracles, but i think faye's appearance is important to the rice-paper plot. spoiler!!! it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting...sorry, my little joke. seriously though, there's all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate. yuck, huh? interestingly enough, mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact. how did she avoid the family curse? something's up with her, obviously.another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars--this movie features one of my all-time movie pet peeves. i refer to the double ending. this movie ends twice. i absolutely hate it when that happens, and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending, didn't like it, and forget to remove it during editing. i guess it's supposed to be scary, but it is only if you're a film editor.there is one perk to this debacle, though, and it's one of the reasons i bought the dvd. the \"filmmaker\" commentary features faye dunaway, and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn't have lines to recite. guess what--the movie sucked so bad i wasn't able to sit through it again. drat. As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. the colors are comic book bold. i think the director got carried away with his \"artistic vision\" over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album \"i'm breathless (music inspired by the film dick tracy)\" which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit \"vogue\" - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). i'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to madonna's \"i'm breathless\" album.if you watch it at home, by end-titles, you'll think \"there's two hours out of my life i'd like to have back.\" save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this. My boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good 'halloween' take-off. a killer terrorizing young people, a white mask...you get my drift. we were dead wrong! no pun intended. we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! it is filled w/plot holes and makes no sense. the actress who plays maddy is pretty, but that's about it. i do give credit for it being shot on a very low budget--i always support movies like that. just not this particular one.this movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high; otherwise don't bother. unless you want to lose your movie privileges like i did!. This film is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my life. a woman \"the ex\" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. the women i don't think ever went to acting college. she just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. failing on most occasions. she makes friends with her ex husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband. at first when you watch this film, you think that the \"ex\" wants to kill her ex-husband, maybe because he has treated her in a bad way. but in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. the two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (using whips of course). my advice to the general public is do not buy this film, do not rent this film and do not watch it like i did (at 1.15am on fox). This movie was pure genius. john waters is brilliant. it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago. the acting is great, although ricki lake could have been better. and johnny depp is magnificent. he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. and seeing most of johnny's movies, this is probably my favorite. i give it 9.5/10. rent it today!. I'll probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie- guess i didn't approach it with the proper dewy-eyed nostalgia of the generation before me. but suffice it to say- st elmo's fire was pretty crap-freaking- tastic, even as far as brat pack films go.here is yet another lovely example of the smug, self-indulgent neurosis that is everything 80s (rent, anyone?) the plot is virtually non- existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best, poorly delivered the rest of the time. the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn't help the situation. there really was no growth, no forward movement at all. even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in. each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest, most predictable way possible. the stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a stalker and andie macdowell is gorgeous. the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is, well, a jackass. the gorgeous slut hides really soulful, deep pain with a wild lifestyle. the poet moods and mopes around for a full 3/4 of the film until he can reveal (!) he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows. the virgin finally becomes a whole, happy human being after getting every virgin's desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he ditches her to really change (for real this time). the cheating bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught. and finally the feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters \"commitment\".which brings me to my final beef- what bond of super-cement was holding these people together as friends? i can't imagine being with just one of them- now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar. and they were all so terrible to each other- heads in toilets, near rape, and sleeping around with everrrryone. the cherry was after two bffs act like total baboons after screwing the feminist, she's like, \"umm, actually i don't want to be with either of you anymore. let's be friends! and we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point, but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment (not that word!).\" and they all smile as if to say, \"golly gee, i never thought of that! what a great idea!\"only it's not. kinda in the way that watching this movie is not. This is by far the worst british comedy ever, how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me. the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander (from the fantastic coupling)right through the cast. the plot/story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas. a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a slot between two excellent shows. describing it as britain's answer to ' meet the parents' does a disservice to 'meet the parents' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog. britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america's sad attempts at doing so. Although the movie was only so so the closed captioning was by far the best i have ever seen! most of the time the spelling is terrible and the captioning out of sync. i use the closed captioning even though i can hear well but find a lot of actors mumble. also many times the sound track overrides the dialogue. thanks!. Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel, however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android (kris kristofferson) and a warrior woman (kathly long) as they face off against lance henriksen and gary daniels (who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie, the most poignant is who's idea was it to cast country singer kris kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets. no, don't get me wrong i could see kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg. strangely one suspects that this was written for dolph lundgren, however lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it. however despite the disastrous casting, kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie. he gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive kathy long. (and kristofferson is playing a robot) despite the miscasting, kristofferson provides the few moments of interest. lance henriksen is slumming and gary daniels is wasted but basically knights is baffling failure. you stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper. (this is a movie where a dismembered kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack) worst of all it ends in a what if sequel, thankfully this has yet to materialize although i still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event.* out of 4-(bad). Joe don baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in goldeneye and made a pretty good bond villan in the living daylights and has appeared in various other movies. one thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in malta. joe don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in malta and the killer gets away. the rest of the movie is seeing joe don chase the killer here and there, joe don getting taken into custody various times, joe don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. the movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for joe don's character. you will be amazed at how many times joe don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. the crowning part of the movie comes when joe don chases the killer all over malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around malta. this movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever. Why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film? has he really been that strapped for cash?the film isn't clear on what it wants to be about, grief?, exotic places?, ghosts?, a vehicle for mr darcy? it's a muddled, muddy mess.there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good, in itself, and that italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland.there are pointless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what it is all about, or why anybody should care simply isn't clear.there was also a yank woman in the film. it wasn't clear what here job was, but she seemed only to be there to make vapid, inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl. was it supposed to be about paedophillia??a pretty dreadful mess, all in all. i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesn't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film. Not near as well made as the \"guinea pig\" flicks it was inspired by (\"flowers of flesh and blood\" or \"devil's experiment\") and not conveying any real philosophy, this video feature, which is barely feature length, adds hardcore sex (with mosaic censoring) to its inspiration. the special make-up effects, which include stomach slitting and disembowelment, are pretty good, if overlit. the amateur feel of the production is a distraction. it all looks cheap and lazy. the lighting is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy. the simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie. just when she gets tired of being abused, the real abuse begins. in the film's hero scene, an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in graphic close-up, stuffs his member inside it, and proceeds to do his thing. i didn't find \"psycho - the snuff reels\" shocking. on the contrary, i found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to one-up \"guinea pig\" and its bloody ilk. interestingly, this was distributed by aroma, a leading fetish producer. The third installment of the \"carnosaur\" trilogy features a bunch of keystone kops-quality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a t-rex. i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really can't be taken seriously. more significantly, however, watching this movie i can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the \"carnosaur\" and \"xtro\" trilogies. the first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an \"alien\" ripoff, and the third is a tongue-in-cheek, almost slapstick (whether intentional or not) movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing. also, like the \"xtro\" franchise, all the \"carnosaur\" movies are completely unrelated to one another. they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the \"sequels,\" i guess. obviously \"carnosaur\" and \"xtro\" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two. Duncan roy's writing and direction is really, and regularly, below par. actually it sort of stinks. aka is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of dorian gray - absurd, contorted dialogue among the 'upper class' characters, at once idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stilted to its core. characterisiation and script - and sometimes the acting - is creaky like a school play...but worse, there's a sort of peacock self-certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped...he's just no good. diana quick must be cringing with embarrassment. dr you should just get out of film...seriously. I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed. slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todd's brand of humor. the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last. maybe i missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience i am glad to be a man. Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? or any taiwanese movie? propably for a reason. this one was a really boring one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.having read other peoples thoughts, i was looking forward for some violence and gore, but there's not much at all. some blood puking and other lame stuff, if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed. they clearly didn't use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent.pretty much nothing good about this movie; a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few ok black magic spells, like the eel one. the plot was confusing and boring. the characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. the horror aspect didn't work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not that scary really). this is the worst asian horror movie i have ever seen. I just saw this on tcm tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by jean arthur. her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over-doing everything was not in the same style as dietrich and art lund. dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing. she being the best thing in this movie. the wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to \"get away\" w/being wicked,witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. it seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny. the ending was totally contrived. spoiler ahead: never for a moment did i believe that art lund suddenly fell outta love w/dietrich and then was suddenly madly in love w/arthur. oh, billy. get real! 3 out of 10. Kol, space prisoner on space death row, manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of america where he, along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'alienator\" a female cyborg killing machine. made one year after the best movie of fred olen ray's career, \"hollywood chainsaw hookers\", this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown. just as low-budget as that earlier film, but not nearly as fun as i had with it. none of the actors really stood out at me. the film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy saturday afternoon, but that's pretty much all it's good for.my grade: d+ where i saw it: showtime thriller. Foolish hikers go camping in the utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. the prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. the victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. however it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by don peake. still, it's business as usual for dead-camper movies.there are much better films in this vein, but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die-hard slasher fans. although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn (1981), wrong turn (2003), or even the final terror (1983) again.* 1/2 out of ****. I could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake was.it's so dreadful. it easily lands a place in my top 10 worst films of 1998.about the only thing it had going for it was bruce willis,who should stick to action films,as a completely emotionless killer who'd kill his own mother for the right price.but i'd rather listen to robbie coltraine talk american for a week than listen to richard gere's nauseating irish accent again.but this film is also implausible,unconvincing,uneven,unexciting,unimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comeback.one for filmroll-footie purposes entirely. This series, made for televisión española (tve) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son.based on a background of historical events, such as the may 1968 student uprising in france, the decaying franco regime, the war in viet-nam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment, one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times, as, it should be stated, anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things.the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato's rôle as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well, manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant, especially noticeable among women, of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart, without any resorting to the use of the brain. as we say in spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. imanol arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series. indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series. his resources are too limited; however, his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad.not really recommendable for other audiences, even spanish-speakers in latin america: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history, such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references. it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers. It opens - and for half an hour, runs - like an educational programme on the old testament, although not without humour. the movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped. in a scene of mixed success martin donovan (jesus) decides to renege on kicking off the apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist 'what's all the fuss about?' play-out, gilded with optimistic conjecture against a (retrospectively, miserably ironic) long shot of the wtc twin towers.apart from donovan's authority, the acting is split. there's the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast: this, though formally contrived for biblical presentation, is appropriate for the modern, paranoid comedy that hartley's aiming at. but i was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of pj harvey (credited thus, and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star entity she is, not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a perilously patchy soundtrack to which contributes). she remained cool - a sort of disingenuous lack of focus - in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film (i'm thinking the jagger of performance here) but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project.ultimately affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience. 4/10. I'm sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't. you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy, slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department.i just sat there through most of the movie thinking \"is this supposed to be funny\" and \"this is the guy from tenacious d right?\". the truth is this film has nothing to offer. at all! it's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. you'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't. i was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. it didn't. 90 minutes later i'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.it's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. yeah it's like that.i've enjoyed some of jack black's earlier movies like shallow hall and i'm really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man. if you do this to us again jack i'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something. at the least give you a serious talking to.i know it's a cliché but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and for so many reasons.... I did not quite get barnens o  it is one of the weirdest ones i have watched. the soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by jean michel jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me, or boring  or confusing. there are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up . probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be \"when you are alone, you can control things \" and \"i will show them \"- or something like that .the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  \"the last summer as a child \"he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max. so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you won't miss much if you don't. Don't get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning, and the material is dramatic. however, it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done.bbc's planet earth was all of the above and more. it was subtle. it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. there was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. it was balanced.disney's edit of earth is none of this. they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about. they made it dramatic. they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us. they made predators evil. they made walruses evil. they showed every encounter as negative. it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded, but at the expense of the lesson of balance. the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive.i am all for preventing global warning, but this was over the top political and environmental junk.that's another thing, i went to see it on the big screen, but was disappointed in the picture quality. it looked better on my tv at home.if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent, or borrow the bbc's planet earth series. it is better lessons, better sound, and (if you have blu-ray)better picture quality. Woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic. an american werewolf in london was, indisputably, a gem of a movie: humorous, demented, with just a dash of romance and so very, very british it made me want to stand up and sing god save the queen every time the movie ended. then came this abomination. you know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered, and actually start cheering for the lycanthropes. tell you the truth, folks, i only got about half way through this cgied travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off. absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time. This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the ruscico dvd release for north america. i don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. anyway, the sound mixing on these dvd's was absolutely horrible. the levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that i didn't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. when it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. occasionally, the orchestra and foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. my wife and i found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these dvd's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. and, like another user has already commented, when we selected english audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between russian and english; and occasionally when the characters spoke in french on the native track the dubbing was in russian, so you're sol if you understand neither. ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. before you fork out $50+ for this movie on dvd for your own library, i'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline. Like 'first blood', this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets, but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire, burnings, stabbings, torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible rambo takes out half of asia, a ton of vietnamese soldiers, most of the russian army, various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at. the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off, allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises. helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is jerry goldsmith, who carefully checks off all the clichéd themes from russian rat-a-tat to chinese ching-chang-chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at. stallone has a brain in his head; this empty nonsense is beneath him. Cool idea... botched writing, botched directing, botched editing, botched acting. sorta makes me wish i could play god and strike everyone involved in making this film with several bolts of lightning. I wish that all the mockumentaries and horror spoofs would go away. if you are going to investigate loch ness..do it for real. enough of the bull****. same with horror and sci-fi..if you are going to make a movie and it is supposed to be scary..make it scary..not funny. i hate when watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for their life(or running or whatever..their life is at stake) and they are cracking jokes. this never happens..cmon where have all the good directors gone? i think horror and sci-fi have really gone down the tube since the 70's. i long for the days that a horror flick was scary..all this \"scary movie\" crap is for the birds. this film is also for the birds. if you really would like to see a good investigation or here serious talk...don't expect it in this video. This movie is lame and not funny at all. the plot doesn't even make sense. some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. who are these people and what are they doing? basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. i didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, i can't think of any part of the movie that was good. I bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again. the excessive amount of watery 'blood' at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the \"whip-around\" wind sounds. my friends and i made a super low budget movie, and the effects still exceeded this crap fest.as for the amount of mistakes in this movie, there are way too many to count. i knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my theatre teacher. ha! final verdict: don't bother with this \"horror\" flick. 3 stars (out of a possible 73). An extremely fast paced,exhilarating, interesting, detail rich book. its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities. not only was tom hanks' mild mannered portrayal or robert langdon laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviances from the original story line, and poor irish/italian accent from carmalengo played by ewan mcgregor, made for the worst book to film ever.as a huge fan of a&d the book, i had high hopes for a more lavish, true to book detailed movie, where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.all the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes.what was impressive was how the... sorry! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.in short - vittoria was the token hottie, a very second to audrey tatou and there were some very nice alfa romeos.i would recommend reading the book to understand that, if ron howard must insist on making another book to film, i would be happy saving my £6.40 for a kfc zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!. I don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! i'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief, but even if i wasn't, the poor acting, very poor casting (sean astin as the brilliant, athletic, and all around individual, harrison?? the guy's completely generic!) and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable. someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was. if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance (sadly, it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie), maybe you'll like this movie. but if you're a vonnegut fan or not completely insane, don't see it. please. I love dissing this movie. my peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for quentin tarantino or harvey keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. here's some huge reasons why: a: the plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. b: that untalented juliette lewis is in it. c: preposterous ideas abound such as actual torso-and-leg guitars, brothers with the last name \"gecko,\" bad vampire make-up jobs, cheech marin playing three characters (?), and a crotch-based gun that only fires when \"erect\" and belongs to a guy who goes by \"sex machine.\" if robert rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence, i might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. the whole project's like he got the ideas by playing with action figures. the only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is george clooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood-sucking, horny-for-children, terrible-acting brother. i swear i think they thought it up right then and there. this movie's out to offend, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. horrible movie. Ty cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. his baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. so of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author al stump. now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards. but instead of focusing on these events, which i guess was simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with clichéd a clichéd plot that will cause any knowledgeable cobb fan to cry vinegar tears. tommy lee jones does quite well as a crotchety cobb, but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy. most stories about cobb are barely believable, but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary. robert wuhl, portraying the writer al stump, is a dark vortex of nonexistent talent. he sucks the life out of every scene, trying to make this film his own nagasaki. there is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore (arliss doesn't count. it's barely a show). even the played out, inevitable \"role reversal\" of cobb and stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter words that don't sound like a poor book on tape narration voice. for all the awful writing and bland film-making on display, there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting it's from the same film is near impossible. a hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying cobb's overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance. the camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster cobb. every slide, hit, and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound, and tommy lee jones owns the intensity of the master player. it makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of cobb in his prime with the same actor. it's worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what could have been. i may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of ty cobb and wanting it to be something it isn't, but to make such boring, neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical. i'm glad ron shelton's career has slid ever since. I watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on fox kids in the uk (very late at night). i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. it's just plain awful! it is no where near in the same league as the transformers, he-man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made. i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses 31 comes on straight after it (that's if mask doesn't put me to sleep first). one of the lesser 80's cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids!. Serious home alone/karate kid knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot. you could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene. oh, and the acting sucks too. although i must say that the line: \"sorry, dude, i have to take a major dump big time\" made me laugh my ass off. Yes, it might be not historically accurate(actually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there), and yes, it has some mistakes and exaggeration(bended machine gun? come on! or the that \"history lesson\" about how afghanistan was never conquered by anyone - educated russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example british campaign in afghanistan). and yes, it does not have multi-million dollars hollywood-style special effects, but it's strongest point in showing soldier's life there, their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes. in my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all those things.again, movie has it weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few years.8/10. This film is an attempt to present jared diamonds theory of \"guns, germs and steel\", explaining how europeans have dominated much of the globe.the version i saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. i think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. there are completely useless scenes of: professor jared diamond watching birds through binoculars, professor jared diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly, professor jared diamond firing a muzzle-loader badly. was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of \"professor jared diamond?\". this part of the documentary was so bad, it could have been a spoof. the worst was when diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an african hospital. none of this helps me understand his theory of \"guns, germs and steel.\" btw, \"guns, germs and steel\" is said about 100 times. \"can the europeans guns, germs and steel get them out of this dire situation? stay tuned and find out!\" when he finally gets down to business, his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring. europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands, because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. do i really need a professor to convince me of this? the parts of his theory that explain how the europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paper-thin.in the end, i think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-europeans are as capable as europeans. if i'm not a racist, i already know this. if i'm a racist, jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements.i don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. kids may enjoy this more than i, though. i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary. This movie is similar to the play entitled 'blithe spirit' written by noel coward. the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to coward's writing. i'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original writer's concept. i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is.sad. these movies are so expensive to produce. i do perk up when a screenplay is original. i even perk up when it's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released. there were some samples mentioned (such as topper, etc.). i realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment. however, i'm not please when the public's taste is taken for granted. in this situation, the public's taste is overlooked.i look forward to better produced movie entertainment.in this case. i rather see the play. This show can most accurately be described as tv bubble-gum: it's chewing, it has a good taste to it, and it lasts a long time. but, like bubble-gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews.this show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games, like hangman, guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list. callers are the contestants, and anybody can play.the questions, though, are terribly easy. there's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop. it never seems to get old, but it never adds much to the show anyway. the hostess, however, regardless of which one that it, is extremely personable, pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions. i rather enjoy that british woman.but there's nothing to this show. it's simplistic and uncompelling, although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on. To say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks. as the other commenter says, this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 (it is especially, incredibly insulting to gays). it is awful - and not in a \"so bad it's funny\" sort of way either - it's just plain awful. no, i have to say it: it stinks! (sorry skunks).from the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for. the \"plot\" is incoherent, the characterization non-existent, the acting is of the over the top mugging \"look at me i'm being funny!\" school and so it goes on. the set pieces are clumsily set up (if at all) and are badly executed, it's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe, i don't remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs).to be fair to the makers, they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title \"also starring ertha kitt as the voice of betty the meteor\" (since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted ms. kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: \"...and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around uranus.\" uranus - \"your anus\" geddit? geddit? huh? huh?? your anus? the humour really is that cheap.it says strange things about the \"comedies\" of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say \"sh*t\" out loud.i paid fifty pence (about $1.00) for this movie in a sale. i feel ripped off. First of all, write the script on a napkin. who needs more than that? after all we're not a hollywood film.then get amateur actors. it will be good for the festival hype. after all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? then, hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light. you see, if it's well-lit, it won't look \"real\" and the festival people won't like it. who needs to have professional level photography anyway? then hire a ten-year old who has never held a camera to be your operator. it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for \"reality\" and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people, critics and a small sliver of the audience who over-intellectualize will scream \"genius\" because they won't believe this was just complete amateur-hour.once you've done that, buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance.what a sad waste. Movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists. new family moves in, cue the overwritten dialog, mediocre acting, green jello salad with shredded carrots, and every other 'inside mormon joke' known to man. anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie. anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there. you'll be much better off watching hess's other movies (napoleon dynamite, etc..) than trying to sit through this one. the acting is mediocre. jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like \"saints and soldiers\", and \"napoleon dynamite\". i would recommend both movies over this groaner. This film has got several key flaws. the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. this means that the film cannot captivate it's audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! in short, it really is very very very very very very very bad! do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman. Some 25 year olds behave like teenagers, coping with the death of a high-school mate, trying to find their purpose in live and love. the script is so lame that i had to force myself to even finish this movie. stay away from it. 1/10. I just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren, whom i hadn't seen in any movies since rocky iv. unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment. the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr. lundgren, who was okay-ish. kata dobó was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make-up.the plot is not at all clever, it's something that's been repeated a million times in different movies. the crooks were utterly stereotypical, and lundgren's character hadn't any depth in it. i didn't really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately this is not even decent action. every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over-the-top unrealism and comic-book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon.i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic-like action, but only if nothing else is available.1/10. (i guess the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie). Seems like some of the previous reviewers has seen another movie than what i saw earlier tonight... actually, this movie is the reason why i registered at imdb. sure bobbie phillips can \"fight\" and for that i give this movie a 2, but the rest of this movie is just pure crap... the acting is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. sure the actors are in physical good shape, but they cannot act! sometimes i enjoy watching bad movies for the laugh, but this movie had no charm and after i saw this movie i was filled with regrets for seeing it. sure, if you would like to see mediocre fighting without anything else then this movie is for you. if not then stay away from this film! ps: sorry for any spelling mistakes... i am just tired as a cause of this movie!. This movie was made for fans of dani (and cradle of filth). i am not one of them. i think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon (still, i'm generally not a fan of black metal). but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it, i convinced myself, that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing. thus i assumed i'm in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background. now, that is what i do like.i got home and popped it in. my patience lasted 15 minutes. awful camera work and disgusting quality. and that was then (2002), that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder. i left it on the shelf. maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this... picture. after a couple of months i got back to it (in mentioned surroundings) and saw half. then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me. my disliking evolved. i noticed how funny dani (1,65m; 5'5\" height) looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart. (yes, ripping. his head apparently had no skull.) i also found that this movie may have no sense. still, i haven't finished it yet, so i wasn't positive.after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back... (yes, it took me 5,5 years.) so - dani in fact was funny as satan/manson/super-evil-man's helper and the movie did not make sense. see our bad person employs dani to do bad things. he delivers. why? well i guess he's just very, very bad. as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it.we have a couple of short stories joined by dani's character. my favourite was about a guy, who steals someone's leg, because he wants to use it as his own. yeah, exactly. the acting's rock bottom. the cgi is the worst ever. i mean stinger beats it (and, boy, is stinger's cgi baaaaad). the story has no sense. and the quality is... let's just say it is not satisfying. the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore. blood and guts are made pretty well. why, you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on. (example - dani 'the man' filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it... and then eats what fell out. why? we never know. we do know, however, that this cat must have been on illegal substances, as his heart is almost half his size.)you might think, after my comment that this movie is so bad it's good, but it's just bad. cradle of filth fans can add 3 points. i added one for gore. I'd really have to rate \"sex is comedy\" as one of the worst pieces of dreck i have ever seen. the film inadvertedly showcases those which are the worst aspects of the french, or at least how they are stereotyped, narcissism, snobbery, and pseudo-intellectualism. i myself am french-canadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me, that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was! one doesn't so much watch this film as undergo torture to it, there was a total lack of humour, and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary interviewing people who were neither famous, nor talented, as if to celebrate something that has never happened to begin with. instead, why not watch auberge espagnole, happenstance, or je t'aime... a la folie, three fantastic modern french films. I really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that (i'm not even kidding)half walked out. shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming-of-age story, the film utilizes david lynch inspired visuals with fassbinder inspired acting. the performances in this film are so dull and bored that i figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script. what's worse is that it's colored like an episode of miami vice. i don't know who this director thinks he is; maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like bunuel, jordowsky, etc. but the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here. i could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago, but when we've got masterpieces such as bad eduction, mysterious skin and show me love why bother with this cinematic turd? there is nothing new to be seen here. Do not watch this movie, go see something else ... i was very disappointed, i cannot rate this movie any better than 3. the acting was quite good and i really liked william dafoe as the villain, but i cannot see why this movie made it to the big screen. the story was old and has been shown in 100+ other movies and 1000+ tv series/movies. the main problem was basically: nothing is happening. take a kidnapping, let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man deliver the money, make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to 95 minutes, you got your \"clearing\" movie. the only 2 reasons i did not rate this a 1 was a) dafoe and b) the \"plan-b-ending\". there are not many endings you can give a kidnapper movie ... 75% of these kind end with ending a, 20% end ending b and 1% ends with something unforeseeable. boring, boring, boring. This movie is absurd. absolutely terrible. michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie. the plot is totally not believable! michael keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective, but then escapes. he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital. he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital, blowing up the power generators and a pedestrial bridge (why?). and to top that andy garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow. the plot is such baloney! maybe the worse movie i have ever see. ... so i thought i'd throw in a few words about william mcnamara. not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- it's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less. there's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies. there's a nice bit where he has to chase after miss eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. william mcnamara is naturally a little on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of a booty. also, there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada. if you're inclined to do so, and come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a \"road trip\" are. i'd just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. can william mcnamara act? heck if i know. This is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen, everything about it is weak and incoherent. the acting is absurd, the costumes even crummier and the story is non-existent. this 'poverty row' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that \"beastmaster\" and \"conan\" enjoyed but it doesn't give us any reason to follow along. the lead character is tepid and dull, he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th century. all the action sequences are like that, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse. don't even bother with this crap. How did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney? nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing.apparently this is director damian niemans heart-piece as he's both written and directed it (and acted in as well). he's a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians. this was his first feature film as far as i know, and chances are it's his last.it's hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor  but i'd say the story and character's are not believable (the screenplay) and the directing doesn't give it any boost (the director). plus  the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner (super-hands, hollywood rules)! the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable. they just end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as \"a few decent scenes\"!. The monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like \"miner's massacre\" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and a couple of embarrassing performances. somebody forgot to tell the writers that \"fool's gold\" refers to the genuineness of the gold, not the people who are looking for it. 3/10. I think this movie had really bad production value. the lack of acting makes me think they should mark it as an early docudrama. it may have had no money available for its making. i feel bad that it was a ruff ride into the major league for jackie robinson.i believe he was much better than many of the white players of his day. he had to be really great to break the color barrier of the time. no getting around that this was a really bad movie.wish there was more info about its makers. they may have been limited by the quality of actors that were willing to take on the project. maybe no money to get good people. In & out made me want to vomit. i have never seen such a shameless film! it seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous, but has no idea how to say it. to me this was not a comedy, unless cruel,sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it. from what i saw, this film had four (4) major flaws starting with (a) matt dillion's character as he announces to the world that is former teacher, howard brackett (kevin kline) is gay. never mind how unbelievable it is that matt dillion character won an oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. but why would he say such a thing? after all, this was never an issue with howard's students, his friends, family, nor his finace. nobody. so why would he say something like it when it wasn't true? more to the point, why doesn't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it? the reason is because there is no answer, and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. the second (b) flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is--the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex. in this movie, being gay is based on liking barbara streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. it's all based on stereotypes!both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony. matt dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing. when he arrives to the ceremony, he says nothing, and i wondered why in the world he then came there at all. he didn't solve anything. then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay, i was so moved i wanted to throw up! those folks were standing up in defense of howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes. what the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why howard was gay. they filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! but wait there's more!during the ceremony,(c) howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher, because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay. what the film was trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit, and that he wouldn't influence his students. but did we not see tom selleck's character endlessly pressure howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, to come out of the closet when, in my mind, there was no closet to come out of? from that, the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting. the film, again, then shoots itself in the foot.and (d) when howard came out of the closet, did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film? i counted only three lines he had afterwards: \"yup!\" to his parents, \"hi there!\" to a student, and \"are you ready?\" to tom selleck before the last vomitous scene. i might be low by one, but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. i wanted to know what was in his head, because i never for once believed he was gay.as bonuses, the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes. one in which howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend (him), who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance. \"does that make him gay?\" he asks. the priest responsed \"oh yes, he's definitely gay\". uh-huh. or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling howard's mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's deep, dark secret because, well...everyone has them. then one the ladies confessed that she's never seen \"the bridges of madison county\". funny? no! becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he/she is gay. i know. i have several friends that are gay, and none of their families took it well at all. that was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation.the last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that tom and kevin were getting married. the camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when... it wasn't what you thought! i had been thoroughly disgusted by that point, and i never could forgive that sick joke. i have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality. \"philadelphia\" and \"longtime companion\" were very honest and true in what they had to say. \"in & out\" is just screaming for political correctness, but has no idea of the corruption at its core. what i gathered from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, meaning if you have the slightless doubt, you are definitely gay. it's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. in reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid, you would eventually believe it too, wouldn't you? this is what happened to howard brackett about being gay. i left the theater sad and angry. angry the whole weekend, in fact. this was a seriously sick and cruel film, the worst of 1997. This is complete and absolute garbage, a fine example of what a bad movie is like, this can't be appealing to anyone, not even b-movie fans. do not, i repeat, do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash. bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but i mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment (of any form) is. i bought the dvd for 3 dollars, i swear i could almost pay someone to take it. burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. i like b-movies, the killer toys, the weird lagoon monsters, but this is nowhere near. you know those movies that are so bad they are funny? not even. just plain old pathetic. Obviously, this is not the \"piranha\" directed by joe dante and produced by roger corman. it wasn't so obvious, when i bought the dvd for only $2.95, as the dvd cover art matched that of the corman produced comedy/horror \"piranha\", even the dvd menu (no features of course) matched the cover. half way through watching this odd movie, my girlfriend and i started thinking, where are the piranhas? once the movie reached the climax we realised that we must have been watching the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer, which had completely different footage, the blurb on the back of the dvd did not match the story we were watching and the credits (actors, producer, director) were also completely different. instead, we got some jungle melodrama about a a girl and two guys who go searching for diamonds and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter. this tame, exploitation thriller is boring and pointless and is only mildly amusing for old-school, camp value. strange that a dvd can be manufactured with the wrong film in tact, but i suppose it is an easy mistake to make seeing as though they are both b-grade movies of the same name made in the 70's. reading other posts made on this film, i noticed that i'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the dvd. how could this be an international error? is there perhaps, some sort of dvd phenomena where unsuccessful films try to get recognition by being put on the wrong dvds? what is going on???. Nemesis 3 is the worst movie what i have ever seen!!! i think that nemesis 3 was only 30 minutes long. and that movie was so boo-oo-ring. when that movie ends and i saw word: nemesis 4... i thought i will...not watch that movie never again. Marlon brando had long since lost interest in acting when he made this film. his performance as \"the swede\" is the worst of his career, and that is precisely what he intended it to be. he doesn't overact. instead, he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his embarrassingly gargantuan girth. the scene where brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst, funniest moment in the history of cinema. as we witness him fall head-first into a toilet, it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in a streetcar named desire, on the waterfront, and the godfather.i guess the real question is why marlon behaved like this in his later years. was he sick of the movie business? did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself? i guess we'll never know. but this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all about.on that note, watch fellow acting veteran donald sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines, embarrassed at himself for agreeing to participate in this travesty. This movie, while it could be considered an alright attempt at comedy, is not what the previews made it out to be. the first half is comprised of typical robin williams stand up material, though he really didn't do many voices; he was always great at the one liners and hitting the punchlines... somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program that is used in the election. here is where the net 3 comes in... a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and the evil corporation wants to shut her up **spoilers** her boyfriend even helps them, though this isn't even fleshed out... this movie could have been one of political brilliance (perhaps with sorken at the reigns) but it falls short in a stew made by too many chefs. This movie stars ben kingsley as frank, a hit man for some russian mobsters based out of buffalo. he is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. after he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to san francisco, where he is to attend aa meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. if you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.it gets worse. well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse. frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete lack of training, but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and the aa meetings are interesting. the viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life. luke wilson is a welcome addition as frank's sponsor, although he is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us he is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). the movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the tea leoni character. she is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to frank flounders, as the two actors have no chemistry together. around the time she comes into the picture, frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. his characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in his behavior. the comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast.problems abound in this one. kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. it alternates between italian, russian, and hispanic. throughout the course of the movie, frank tells numerous people he is a hit man (including an entire aa group), but nobody seems to care, or wants to do anything about it. the movie relies on cliché scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when leoni's insufferable character chases frank down at the airport, just when he is about to board a flight back to buffalo.though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense. at the end of the film, frank celebrates one year of sobriety. i hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen \"you kill me\". my grade: d+. A singularly unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the then-cutting edge rock 'n' roll explosion with the middle-class sensibilities of a suburban sitcom. the result is a jarringly dated mish-mash that will satisfy none of the audience that went for the music, but will at least keep their parents sated.a quick glance at the promo write-up on the back of the video release should give some idea of the content. tom ewell is a drunken agent, overplayed with so little comic ability you almost expect him to bellow \"hi honey, i'm home!\" the blurb sites him as \"so funny in 'the 7 year itch'\". it sounds almost like an excuse. what other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else? it reads like \"so funny in 'the 7 year itch' ... but he's rubbish in this\".mansfield, a beautiful girl with rumoured 50-inch assets, is, unfortunately, a bargain basement monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting haddock. her wooden delivery combined with ewell's ott double-takes make this a comedy partnership from hell. for her part, the sell gives us: \"[jayne mansfield] whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the film's biggest laughs!\" as you can see, a movie sold on the idea that it's lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things. most of this \"humour\" is men literally falling over themselves, their glasses cracking upon site of mansfield, etc. only the freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing casts doubt upon its \"u\" certificate.for the musical side, the most adenine of players are chosen. would you really care to see eddie fontaine offer: \"i love your eyes, i love your lips, they taste even better than potato chips\" in a song called \"cool it, baby\"? only the incendiary little richard breaks out of the mor, though is forced to sing some of his more dad-friendly songs in a four-minute sequence. and how come all the acts sing without a single microphone? attempted satires on the industry are broad and childlike in their conception.technically, the picture was quite advanced, with special effects (including a ghost-like julie london) and deluxe color (which now looks flat and artificial. in fact, with its reds that bleed and fake-looking flesh tones, it resembles a colorised movie). direction, though, isn't outstanding, and the sound quality is also quite poor.perhaps it comes down to it being so old. a time when men still smoked on screen, sickeningly cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance. (all of which happen here). yet some like it hot, the african queen, ben hur and many, many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today, so the \"good at the time\" argument doesn't really stand up. at its heart the girl can't help it is a cynical and patronising venture that doesn't bear close inspection. 4/10. The summary provided by my cable tv guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. \"slaughterhouse rock\" is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen, a title previously held by \"urban legends: final cut\". from its opening scene i could tell it's going to be really bad, but i was so bored that i couldn't care less. this film contains laughable acting, especially by the guy who's tormented in his dreams, incredible as in not credible plot twists, and some of the crappiest music i've heard, and i'm living in a period when the likes of britney spears and nsync dominate the air waves. the biggest problem with \"slaughterhouse rock\" is that it's not funny. one would a film as dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one-liners here and there, but no. we have tormented guy's self-centered friend trying to be funny, but came across as annoying instead. (spoiler) and please, do tell me, who in this crazy world is insane and self-loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night? no one! if you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable. this one is anything but. As the above suggests, i was ultimately unimpressed with this movie. it is lovely to look at, the scenery is lush, but the detail of the story, in particular the characters, are totally unbelievable. films don't have to be believable, but films like this, with a political edge and social commentary do. similarly, i have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again, films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw. this is absolutely the case with sutherland, who is frankly rubbish as doyle. his accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent is his performance, and we end up with a caricature of irishness with no personality outside of his nationality. i find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job. all in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when you're trying to be the mission, this kind of thing wrecks your chances of success.speaking of accents, there were a couple more problems, one being the striking modernity of boy's accent which acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time. more surprising was samantha morton's much lauded irish accent, which was variable to say the least. her voice meandered between strong north and soft south, even in the voice-overs, where i would've expected any such discrepancies to be picked up.however, these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of sarah. she never seems at home with the english, and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a no-brainer. perhaps a lot has been lost in editing, perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things could've been fleshed out, but i can only judge what i've seen.now the biggest problem, sarah's (morton) relationship with doyle (sutherland) is incomprehensible. the fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son, the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me. as you may have guessed. this movie didn't work at all for me, but it is top notch to look at, you really won't see anything more stunning in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife liked it. Blond main character, always believes in everyone and when you stick together you can do anything! shy guy best friend with curly hair (rip off of gordo) wants to be a movie director has a secret crush on zoey. spanish best friend (rip off of miranda) weird smart girl quinn (rip off of lary tudgemen)and the popular stock up prep logan (rip off of kate)and zoey's little brother max, annoying (rip off of matt)zoey is the semi popular girl, with 2 best friends. the only thing it's missing is the funny little sacastic cartoon lizzie mcguire has, and hillary duff was a lot cuter. jamie lynn spears looks more like a tooth pick in a tube top. This piece of crap is actually the bomb, as in bottom of the barrel. i can't figure out which is worst; norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or christopher neame's hysterical overacting. this film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. the action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. you can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.visually the film does nothing for me. it actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flick and a miami vice rip-off with a little sprinkling of hell-spawn. no, wait. that should have been hell-yawn. Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined. we have the submissive, heroin-addicted, part-time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. now, she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor, the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water. we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then chopping her up. we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom. you see, it's all circular. deep, huh? the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's tormentors. it's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be. if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious, no wonder most people think artists are insane. we saw this lousy movie, then put on \"zero woman, the accused.\" oh my god, it was a tossup as to which one was worse. what is going on in japan these days? sick, sick, sick. My friends and i rented this for \"bad movie night\" with high hopes, but the brain was something of a letdown. the brain itself is gloriously goofy-looking, but it mostly just sits on its little platform. who thought that it would be cool that the brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawn-out minutes? this movie has a number of things going for it at first, including an estevez-knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius (we're told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts, which include putting krazy glue on someone's chair). it also has some great lines, a hilariously out-of-shape and out-of-breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere, and, yeah, some chick gets naked. however, the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing. during the last half things just start to drag on and on, with at least 3 or 4 pointless, boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot. the scenes inside the pri complex are especially bad. at least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell. i could've fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour- more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more brain action. if you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down. maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie- i started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest. This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. in fact, despite ed wood, jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of wood. now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the wood epics (such as plan 9 and bride of the monster), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than wood's! however, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. like a wood film, it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends.the film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet. however, out of nowhere, a ufo streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the air force. however, later, they realized that the ufo didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! but, when soon after this planes start disappearing all over, they realize there must be something to his sighting.so far, the film isn't great but it's watchable. however, by the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. first, through horrid use of stock film and crappy models, airplanes keep changing mid-flight. some may not be bothered by this, but with airplane lovers like me, seeing an f-80 turning into an f-86 to an f-102 fighter plane made me crazy--especially since the planes look nothing like each other. second, through \"clever\" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! this is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly, it will be worth the wait. well, no such luck!! the \"monster\" looks less realistic or scary than the duck from groucho's \"you bet your life\" tv show!! in fact, it's significantly less realistic than any of the japanese giant monsters!! in fact, big bird from \"sesame street\" is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! it's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history--about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in robot monster or teenagers from outer space!!! the bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. bad film fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! all others...be afraid,....be very afraid!!fyi--you might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies!! i am positive the crashing washington monument scene was stolen from earth vs. the flying saucers but i also saw a couple other scenes that i swear are from other films. what a hack job!. Since i was just finishing the book, `mrs. dalloway' by virginia woolf, i was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. what i encountered, however, is a film that was boring, incomprehensible and non-sensical. one cannot entirely blame the film, it tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the source material is virginia woolf, and is almost entirely written in stream-of-conscience style with extended periods of internalizing and little actual dialogue, one would certainly think that there shouldn't be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it. vanessa redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor do any of the other actors. it is just simply a film that could not intelligibly be made from the story that woolfe wrote, and should not have even been attempted. don't watch the movie, read the book. --shelly. The bone snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the namib desert. when the find them, they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. the story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this. the characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good.about an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean, you sigh \"oh, that is really stupid.\" the movie is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting ending. up until that point, the movie was pretty good, and it is a shame that it took such a bad turn. so i cannot recommend this movie. i gave it a 4/10. First of all i must admit batman: the animated series is the best batman series by far. we watched it when it used to be on tv. i didn't realize that there was a season four. actually there wasn't. btas ends with season 3, and it should have stopped there.why did they have to mess with a good thing. catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible grey faces. the joker looks beyond scary, it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier. he doesn't seem to have pupils anymore, and now he doesn't even look remotely human (although he is).bruce wayne is voiced by kevin conroy who does the best batman. although he now looks like superman. there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, bruce wayne now has blue eyes.night wing really needs a haircut, please! alfred just has pupils from eyes, looks more like a character from the 80's.i have watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood in every episode).if you are a fan of batman: the animated series, there is no batman season 4. they just included this series as season 4 for marketability. if they just released it as the new batman adventures i don't think as many people would have bought it.save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3. How sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1. i watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching. every single part of the film was awful. music, acting, direction, story, everything, simply everything. i actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film. i particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion, and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand, because, .............well. just because. product placement? crucifix's (crucifi?) everywhere. if you are of a christian persuasion and very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. if you do like this movie, you really need to get out more. Just recently, i've been obsessing over and anticipating this movie so much that i almost had to see it. well, having just seen it today, the 5.8 rating is completely understandable. i think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a dire need, it turns out not to be worth it. sure, the hills have eyes 2 has its moments. it has a very cool and well-developed storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself, but the whole thing is so self-indulged that it becomes so hard to follow. and if it weren't for wes craven's production on this film, it wouldn't be anything to do with the original remake. but the whole thing makes you go \"is this supposed to be horror or comedy?\" because there are lots of ridiculous, randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners (i.e. \"there's a hand in the sh**er!\" or \"you motherfu**er! i'll kill you all damn sons of b**tches!\") and the acting (god don't even remind me how bad it was.storyline: (this part contains spoilers, beware!) the movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby (ooh la la!), and then the screen fades to black with the movie's title appearing, and a monologue. then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins. we find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants. the box to keep track of audio feeds is gone, and everyone dies! after that tone-setting opening, you'd expect more.then, we go to this one team of military recruits training in baghdad. as the captain parades them \"a good job at stupidity\", their last day of training is in new mexico, the desert where the family in the last thhe had stayed because they were stuck. while in training, things go ultimately wrong, people die, and... do i need to tell you any more? because right now i have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type this.the thing that's wrong with thhe2 is that it just dosen't work. no flashbacks here, and the ending is pretty safe... but with a twist! a stupid one, that is. i'm pretty sure the ultra super director's cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to the hills have eyes 3 will showcase all of it's alternate endings, but at this point, i'm not sure if i care. so by all means, if you loved the first thhe so much it's almost a sin not to see this, then by all means, see it. but if else, then, avoid at all costs. it's for your own good.3/10. After the debacle of the first sleepaway camp, who thought that a franchise could be born. sc ii is superior in aspect. more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun. while that might not be saying much (compared to the first movie), sleepaway camp ii is worth the rental.pros: entertaining, doesn't take itself too seriously like sc i. inspired killings. cons: crappy acting and mullets abound.bottom line: 5/10. Lonesome dove is my favorite western second only to the searchers with john wayne. i watch lonesome dove about every 6 months and never get tired of it. i have read all the ld books, although i cannot remember much of comanche moon. i too looked forward to this mini-series and decided to tape it on our dvr so we could fast forward through commercials. unfortunately, i messed up and didn't record the first part, but decided to watch the other parts and try to pick up.there is nobody that can ever compete with robert duvall or tommy lee jones, and i was expecting to be disappointed and i was.although there were so many things that didn't ring true, the most apparent to me was when nellie died the day before and gus was out on the range, it switched over to clara writing him a letter from nebraska telling him how sorry she was to hear of her death. how in the world could she have known the next day way out in nebraska? additionally, it was supposed to be 7 years later after her leaving and her children looked to be about 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, yet more time went on before they actually moved to lonesome dove, and in lonesome dove they had been there about 10 years or longer before leaving to montana. when they stopped at clara's in nebraska, which probably took another 6 months on the trail, the girls looked to be about 10-13, since they were playing in the yard like little children. the math just does not add up.i agree that the man who played gus had a lot of his mannerisms and looked a little like gus may have looked as a young man.i am also a little confused about one thing. the captive white girl that they brought back - was she the one they captured when they raided austin? they said she had been captured 25 years ago, but if she was the one captured in austin, it was only 7 years later when this took place in the movie. was she captured earlier? i remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the town and don't know if this is the same one. if someone can explain since i missed part 1. if it had been 25 years, she would probably be over 40 years old when they found her since she looked to be grown lying on the ground. also, the way they were ravaging her when they captured her, it is hard to believe she would have lived to go on to be married and having indian children.i have to admit though, nothing is worse than john voight playing call in the sequel to lonesome dove or the unbelievable marriage of lorena to pea eye in the mcmurty sequel to lonesome dove, which was never explained either. also, the way he killed newt off was i hear from spite for them doing the sequel with john voight without his approval.if anyone can clear up these discrepancies, i would appreciate. If i could give it a zero, i'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot, doesn't make sense of what is happening. just plain boring. please don't waste your money on this one. pleaseee!!! this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story, but nopes, i didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it. do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3-4 times than watch this crap! i don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well. zodiac killer should be called 'boriac killer' instead!!!. Being a fan of the manga and anime of go nagai (devil man, devil lady, violence jack, etc.), i was looking forward to this one. i'd seen neither the manga nor the anime, so i had no preconceived notions going in. good thing, too. what we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. while it's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers (our hero's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued-on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies. while i have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes, i do dislike amateurishly made movies (there are at least four in this series). on the plus side, there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes i saw. it's no wonder nagai's testicle boy never made it... For those viewers who thought the 1979 film \"alien\" the first to depict a male earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, \"night of the blood beast,\" made 21 years earlier, may come as something of a surprise. in this film, america's first man in space crashlands back on earth and, after examination, is thought to be dead. he later comes to again, only with a half dozen or so alien seahorse thingies growing in his abdomen. the mama (?) alien also pops up to terrify the small band of scientists who are observing our gravid hero, and she (?) seems to have the body of a bear and the head of yarnek, the rock creature from a 1969 \"star trek\" episode. anyway, with its short, 62-minute running time, small group of scientists, and cheap-looking monster, this film suggests nothing less than a grade z warm-up for \"the outer limits\" (which would premiere four years later), but without the fine writing that that show usually boasted. despite the lurid title, this film is decidedly sci-fi, not horror, and offers no scares, no laffs, little suspense and little food for thought afterwards. it looks as if it cost around $100 to make (but probably cost twice as much), and its musical score often seems to have no relation to the happenings (i won't use the word \"action\") on screen. by the film's end, many questions remain: just how was our hero to give birth to these critters? why does the alien need to decapitate people to learn our language? (to justify that title, no doubt!) why can't the space-traveling aliens land on our planet, rather than needing to hitch rides on our ships? how was our hero impregnated to begin with? these are all matters that this little cheapie can't be bothered with. it really is for 1950s sci-fi completists only. Spoiler alert  although i think this one was spoiled coming out of the can it's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars, from this studio, made at this time period, could be so awful, but it is. it is the film's biggest flaw by far that it just doesn't make any damn sense.rich widower american aristocrat penn gaylord leaves his small daughter \"in charge\" and goes off to world war i where he is killed. then we flash forward to present day (1942) and total confusion. the three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years, and some jerk named barclay is trying to take their home away from them. this is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script, more holes in it than the warren report. what happened to the gaylord fortune? if the will is worth half a billion, why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on the munsters? who the devil is this barclay clown? and why is he able to take someone's home away from them? the questions just pile on top of more questions.the usually affable and charming george brent is playing barclay, who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone, taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt; yet no one besides fiona (barbara stanwick) seems to particularly dislike this cretin. why? none of these questions are ever answered. we instead just follow fiona's life from one train wreck to another, the evil barclay takes away her home, her fortune, and even her child. what does she do? shoot him? set him on fire? no, too logical. in a completely improbably wrap-up, this woman, who's only prior romantic involvement with barclay was, save for the technicality of marriage, rape, suddenly decides mid-sentence (literally) that she does not hate him, she loves him. and they're going to live happily ever after. all of a sudden for no reason in the world, this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle-twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era. yeah, sure, steal everything in the world that belongs to me and i'll fall in love with you. on what planet does that happen? i can only guess the reason i never heard of this film before i happened to catch it on turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today. Shakalaka boom boom is a rip off from the movie amadeus. i personally rate amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life-time, but for his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35, being virtually uncelebrated during his life time because of the politics played by some people, particularly saliere, the italian composer, who was jealous of him.personally, i was shocked to see shakalaka.., as the director has invariably cut-pasted most of the scenes from the movie amadeus. i see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies bollywood keeps on churning day by day. the movie is a disaster, the two musicians in the movie don't give you any feeling of being realistic, the film is tasteless, meaningless and total failure on every count. the only person who makes an impact is bobby deol, who at least knows how to act. otherwise, the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs.the irony is that while watching the movie, the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie, because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended. i wish i could take darshan and co. to court not only for copyright infringement, but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art. Well, dude where's my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written, cast, filmed & edited in less than a day. i honestly can't believe this got made (or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing). the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be \"dumb-funny\", and the actors involved don't seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it. oddly enough, unlike most mindless slapstick comedies, this movie actually has too much plot - every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot. of course, they were obviously going for moronic, but it doesn't work on any level whatsoever...there is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed: donkeylips from the old nickalodean show \"salute your shorts\" has a very small role. this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though, you just watch... I have never seen a movie so bad. it's not even entertaining enough to be a drinking game.it's so bad, i don't even want to talk about it... and that's the whole point of this, isn't it? please. don't bother to see this movie. 'nuf said. After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside, you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. then the movie takes a turn for the worse. the warm feeling might still be there, but as others has said: the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch. the movie gets sped up, and you get the impression that you're either fast forwarding through it, or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out.realism isn't a goal onto itself, but as a viewer, i'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic, it just happens to be.on the plus side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad script, i think that the actors performances are mainly good. if i could rate the first 25 minutes only, i'd probably give it an eight. as it is now, it gets a four. ...and that's being nice! if you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways. if not, i'd recommend that you watch something else. Wesley snipes is james dial, an assassin for hire, agent of the cia and pure bad-ass special operative. during his free time dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as beauty.enter agent collins, his supervising officer. enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in uk custody. of course the united kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head-shots outside of courtrooms.the assassination is a big success apart from the fact, that the escape plan blew. so dial's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police, whilst dial becomes hot property with the london coppers trying to get to him and cia trying to dispose of him.fortunately for dial the safe-house is routinely visited by a teenager emily day (eliza bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil uk law enforcement...with a script like that need i say more? on the plus side wesley snipes is wesley snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging. on the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach. One of boris karloff's real clinkers. essentially the dying karloff (looking about 120 years older than he was)is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies. moving from morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories. desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying. she will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo (who i think is married). if you think i got that from watching the movie you're wrong, i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened. why? because this movie had me lost from two minutes in.i had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines. little is spelled out and much isn't said until towards the end by which time i really didn't care. its a dull mess of interest purely for karloff's performance which is rather odd at times. to be honest this is the only time i've ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory. its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out. I thought this was a truly awful film--i found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times. one or both of the gay male leads was miscast; there was absolutely no chemistry between them and richard ruccolo looked like he'd rather be kissing a dog. the movie covers their long and tortured courtship, highlighting each break-up and make-up, but not developing the reasons in-between in any detail. these reasons would make for some interesting characters, not the fight or the make-up scene in bed (lame even if you liked the movie).andrea martin and adam goldberg shine as their characters, but it doesn't make the film worth renting. save your money. As i'm listening to my parents watch this (after i gave up 10 minutes into the film), they have absolutely no idea what is going on. when \"charles dickens\" stared into the camera, i half expected him to turn into a demon (yes, he looked like one). unfortunately, that didn't happen.this movie had various reasons i did not finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. i mean, seriously, it was sloww. you can only understand 10% of what is said, and the characters were poorly introduced.if you have an english accent and you like a lottt of talking, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laughs, and the same music/sound effects played over and over and over, then this is the movie for you...1/10 - completely horrible.avoid at all costs. This is a good time to say how good i think of this site: it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration i lived for two hours, awaiting for something to happens, for something to be said, to be shown, to be insinuated subtly, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. no, just long, endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. boring is the long death of the mind, and this movie is, from that point of view, a public enemy. how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators. i don't claim for my money back, just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing... oh god !. I was looking forward to this movie. trustworthy actors, interesting plot. great atmosphere then ????? if you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. first. know it. ok i did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but i thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire-which! they almost did. things i didn't get. a woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone-oblivious to the consequences. great riddles that fell by the wayside. the promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so-called criminal. i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. i understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found adrian pauls role crucial and penetrating and then ????? basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so. what? run out of ideas! such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly. it may not comprehend the meaning and i really did not expect the writers to understand it but i was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road. Spoilers: the original road house is one of those movies that i know is clichéd and unoriginal, yet it's done so well, i'm embarrassed to admit i really like it. turns out many of my friends, whose movie opinions i respect, think the same way. so when they attempt to make a sequel to it and it's as if it was written by some high school kids who were given the rights to do a sequel, it's just bad; really, really bad.oddly, johnathon schaech is listed as one of the writers and i can only hope his wga membership is revoked. the writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialog in this millennium. schaech already appearing to be the king of the straight-to-dvd sequel (8mm 2, poison ivy 2) and now after seeing this and 8mm 2, i'm thinking his acting ability is non-existent. he was awful, just awful.and it's not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, they're bad. every fight scene is a slowly delivered punch (yet still making the \"wiff\" sound in the air) that is then blocked by the opponent, who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground. this is repeated throughout the film, worse than any bad 1970s cop show. or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of cherry kool-aid for some reason. and we're supposed to believe will patton is a fighting machine; his fight scenes look so amazingly fake i was honestly embarrassed watching. it's the complete lapses of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible. for instance: johnathon schaech's character is in town for a day and already tells some girl he barely knows who he has no idea what side she's on, \"i'm with the feds, but don't tell anyone.\" the female villain, who fights the good girl in one fight scene with acrobatics that rival any super hero, yet is easily held down by the will patton, \"old guy,\" in another scene by simply holding both her hands while he utters some ridiculous line (\"stab me once, shame on you, stab me twice, ain't gonna happen\" whew, that's bad) and then head-butts her. jake busey's villain shoots at the feds while caught in the middle of a drug deal, yet no dea agents or anyone simply go to his place and pick him up after, in fact, he's simply let go because \"this is the sheriff's territory.\" busey wants the bar because it's \"in a great location\" for drug deals, yet his own house appears to be just as good apparently offering all the perks the bar is supposed to have. johnathon schaech's character is supposed to be the son of patrick swayze's character in the original, yet swayze's character's last name is dalton and schaech's isn't (nor is the supposed brother of swayze's character). and johnathon schaech looks about 50 in this movie. i looked it up, he's 17 years younger than swayze, but he looks awful.but my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most stock fight scene ending in movies: the villain is knocked through a window on a second floor and as they pan down i'm thinking \"please don't tell me he's impaled on something...\" and sure enough, my worst fears were realized.actually, i could go on for another half hour about the things i hated about this movie. suffice to say, let's put an end to these ridiculous straight-to-dvd sequels to theatrical movies, at least the ones with johnathon schaech. `it's as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head.' -pattipatti (christina ricci) is a sarcastic teenaged girl, bored with her all-too-average little town. bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor lady's whereabouts. now, with the help of her precious cat `d.c.' and an inept fbi agent (doug e. doug) she must find her.that darn cat is a bad movie. it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat. there are, however, a few buds of talent in it. doug e. doug was good in cool runnings. his performance as `senga' was really funny. here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent. he does have a good scene when he imitates the cat, though. micheal mckean plays patti's father. his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. this poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed, gets arrested for picking up his own cat, and gets bitched-at by his snippy wife and still doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles. i wish my old man was like that. the only real good performance is christina ricci's. she entertaining as the ever-annoyed patti, but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down. you might also recognize peter boyle (young frankenstein, everybody loves raymond), the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers, in this movie. this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. even the cat isn't very good... i really can't recommend 1997's that darn cat. some young children (under 8) might enjoy it a bit, but every one else should look elsewhere. if you're looking for a good christina ricci movie, i suggest addams family values, the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow. if a fun family film is what you're after, try snow day, instead. I love horror films, low budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's.. but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film? let's compare it to titles in a similar vein- haunted house films. the haunting, the changeling, the shining. or for a similar technology based horror film that was faaar better, (though still far from great) demon seed. ok, i'll be fair.. let's compare it to made-for-tv horror films! don't go to sleep.. waaay creepier and better done. salem's lot, the night stalker, night gallery, even don't go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better. *spoilers* first of all, for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was, you have a scene like the opening scene.. oh boy! the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers! terrible. also, just what we understand about the house.. it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on, and it's a very emotional house. not a spirit, or demon, or entity, it's a house thats \"possessed\", but by what? we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie/margaret, our protagonist? now that i'm on the topic of suzie.. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old crazy lady comes, tells you she was your nurse, pours her heart out, falls in the boiling pool, struggling in agony for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her's life? no, she stands there and watches! the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film, but that's where the positives end. for at least a more interesting, and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed: the bed that eats. i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven't watched it since it originally aired, or remembered it scaring them as children. this film was pretty much merit less. From the film's first shot - keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself.joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing-rooms, but a sort of u-certificate wuthering heights. thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. not to mention that jane austen, and in particular p & p, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. it's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. which was completely ignored, so that the bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.it was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. the humour - which is pride & prejudice, both austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. pride & prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. you can't lose jane austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? a lot of giggling and staring into the distance? rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. and where the great strength of austen's elizabeth (at least in austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, knightley's elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. in which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by matthew macfayden.donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic. his special bond with lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. mr bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache. I've seen this film several times in a variety of short-film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer! for a school-film is very well produced and directed, but the story... well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film. the character named tim watcher needed some in-dept approach. this is something that lacks in some portuguese short films - the script is always superficial.but still... i liked this movie...parabens! (congratulations!). I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo , michelangleo, raphel and donatello so venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle. Honestly, mr. thalluri.... if you do a drama movie in a high-school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you mess up the time-frame and jump back and forth... if you do that, you can't use the exact same visual story telling device of \"elephant\" which is using a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles. you just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating.where \"elephant\" (which was released 3 years prior to this movie) uses school shootings (or to be exact the columbine shooting) as the focal point for its script 2:37 uses teen suicide and seeing the reviews the shock value of that subject worked. its the same slow story telling, a lot of dramatic piano music all leading to a finale you know from the beginning. at least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. so you got a untypical gay guy who looks acts like a stoner/skater, a hunky lover-boy who can't deal with his gay side, brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here comes the nose dive. you also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever... a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of \"2 urethra syndrome\" who actually never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does so every day! wow, as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing i have ever heard. he gets beaten up on the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. thats new-age realism directly leading to \"the twist\" and final character who turns out to be the suicide victim...after watching the \"very realistic\" life of teenagers (one day including, incest-rape, teen pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before, kind of like your \"very realistic\" daily soap... trying hard to be) we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him (in a thoughtful piano playing sequence btw, seen that somewhere before??). and it gets even better... before slitting her wrist in a painful long scene of \"yes\" and \"no\" she asks 2-urethra-guy if he is ok, constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors in a school toilet. now you got a movie that is a total rip-off of elephant, fails with some really sloppy story telling (the whole rape-incest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way) and people call this a shocker.what the heck is going on?? is all it takes to take some pseudo-dramatic music, boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here?? i think elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious rip-off failing on many more levels. i have never ever seen a more brazen stealing of a whole movie concept in my life... and believe me i watched a hundred of horror movies so i know how low you can go there. this is a total let down in all departments... its nor realistic, its stolen, its damn slow and by all means i wonder whats more useless... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch romeo+juliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear non-romantic and more realistic way) or this ridiculous set up... come on! i am still trying to work out if 2-urethra-guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous. Something strange is happening in loch ness. the water is crystal clear, nor cold. a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills scots! what is this movie?! first, i love reading stories about nessie, sea monsters in general. when i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. no. it was terrible! the story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical nessie they used. it was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything. not worth your while, just leave it on the shelf (or garbage can) you found it on. on second note, this film was shot in cailifornia, not loch ness, a major diss to nessie fans. There are two kinds of characters on the shield: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and everyone's only hope. more than any other show, the shield is about hypocrisy and self-delusion. unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes, and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again, making fools out of all of their peers.the show boasts excellent camera-work. the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb. it really is a work of art to see. unfortunately the story is a cartoony, overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence, rape, and lies.the hero, who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme, is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character, always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds (anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications. if another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause. every time.like 24, this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season. boring, unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody, perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover-ups.most disappointing though, is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth, to and away form the characters on whims. sometimes, they want us to see shane as the enemy. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul. sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel. then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane, that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic.none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends, that's it. it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. but then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses. I broke my own rule buying this movie from the $5.88 bin at walmart. basically, if a movie has a big star in it, and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. well in the case of this movie, the reason is because it sucked! they plaster sandra bullock's photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait, and it reeled this little fishie right on in. i was thinking of donating the disc to charity, or giving it to the library, but i don't think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie. worst lines: \"what do you mean army buddies?\" \"what do you mean your dad?\". (spoilers)the one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst dye jobs ever. that, and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal steiner's invention. mst3k does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny.i particularly like it when crow kills mike with his 'touch of death', and when he revives him in the theatre, mike cries \"guys, i died, i saw eternal truth and beauty! oh, it's this movie...\" that would be a letdown, having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of the projected man. the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide. some of the puns in the film were wicked: police inspector-\"electrocution!\" crow-\"shocking, isn't it?\" police inspector-\"that's lowe, all right\" tom servo-\"very low, right down by the floor!\" police inspector-\"can i get on?\" tom servo-\"he's dead, but knock yourself out\" mst3k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer. I really liked the movie 'the emporer's new groove', but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having \"relations\" with a llama. seriously, this movie was bad. it's like club dread after super troopers. i am supposed to write 10 lines, but i don't even know what else to say. i laughed a couple of times, but only because i was drinking. a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk. it was not. maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people aren't. either way, just stick with the emporer's new groove if you want a funny, cartoon, llama-themed movie. line 10 is this line right here. Although coming after three star wars, krull & countless others, this movie would look outdated in the 1950s... 1 sfx mostly consist of 1970s videogames effects such as bolts etc; annoying after a short while. you also get a sfx creature that looks like a poor man's version of some tier-iv harryhausen monster.2 sets are mainly ruins in the countryside, with papier-mache temples and miniature cities or abodes that makes 1950s japanese monster movies look like flawless perfection.3 plot is paper extra-thin...hercules must find zeus' seven golden thunderbolts stolen by conspiring gods & zombie tyrants.4 action mainly consists in retarded, muscled-up hercules ( check the variety of facial expressions ) wrestling cheap 1970s videogames effects.5 acting award goes to milly carlucci (third carlucci show-biz sister with anna & gabriella ), which says all.6 sfx make other tier-ii italian salad bowl movies such as l'umanoide & star crash look like masterpieces.well, considering that ferrigno's main acting exploit consisted in impersonating a retarded green monster, wearing a whig and green espadrillas, we ought to be lenient.watch it & forget about it. That is the only question i am left with. why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast? why was the writing so bad, it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters? why did it not make any sense at all? why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and \"hollywood\" the hell out of it when all it needed was good, smart story telling? why? i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released. i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey, who are oscar winners, that this never is released to the big screens in america.as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism, the whole story is just utterly laughable. i just...think the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a cliché, and an awful one at that. just. no. This movie earns its 3 for lousy writing, poor technical merit and continuity problems. some people have given this movie a 10--and perhaps that is okay if you are simply scoring it for its fun factor. however, technically this is an inept movie serial from start to finish--produced by 3rd-rate writers, actors and crew. that really was true of nearly all the serials because they were meant as low-brow entertainment particularly aimed at the kids. and there's nothing wrong with that, but \"high art\" it ain't!! spy smasher earns a lower than average score compared to other serials because it is of even lower quality and has major continuity problems--even for a serial. it was common for a serial to have a \"cliff hanger\"--i.e., a moment at the end of the episode that looked as if the good guy dies but miraculously survives when the next episode began. but, in this film, it's much hokier and ridiculous. you would literally see the hero die in the last episode, but in the next, they re-shot the scene and showed he actually didn't die (even though they clearly showed him buy the farm in the last one)! again and again in spy smasher he seems to die but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and he somehow avoided death--even if he fell 1500 feet into a river, fell into a buzz saw or whatever.watch this movie not for its quality but either for a good laugh or to learn what it was like to go to the movies on saturday mornings decades ago. This movie has every cliché of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie.however, it is not entirely unwatchable, thanks to good performances by rowland, loken and smallwood (and maybe enberg).what is amazingly bad, though, is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes. boy, oh boy, the cgi scenes in \"the last starfighter\", filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). the feeling of cheepnis really sends shivers down your spine.a pity, this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste. I really wanted to see this film - i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. a cop (andy garcia) has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live. the only match is a convicted serial killer, who escapes from jail. to save his son he has to track down the killer.michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film. keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring. it's over-the-top to the point where you just stop caring.garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par. barbet schroeder (at one time such a promising director with films like \"barfly\" that amounted to pretty much nothing in the american market) directs well enough - i honestly thought the script was the culprit here...it's just a big mess.the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script. what should have been a tense and thought-provoking film is just a hollywood action dud. **possible spoilers** three young people on the wrong side of the law are given a chance to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by becoming undercover cops in `the mod squad,' a resurrection of the hit television series of the 60's, directed by scott silver. given their less than stellar backgrounds, and because of who they are and the people they know, julie barnes (claire danes), pete cochran (giovanni ribisi) and lincoln hayes (omar epps) can go places other cops can't, so they are tapped by captain adam greer (dennis farina) to infiltrate a seedy night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring. for a start, julie gets a job there as a waitress, while pete and linc just `hang out' to find out what they may. julie quickly becomes reacquainted with an old boyfriend, billy waites (josh brolin), who turns out to be involved with drugs, which are tied in to the shady dealings going down at the bar. before it's over, the `squad' is in it up to their necks, while also running afoul of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs, and consequently tied in with their investigation. from the beginning of the movie, there is a sense that you are coming in late; as if it's presupposed that you know what's going on as far as the origin and workings of the squad. all you get here are brief mug-shot bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse into their past; there's nothing about how this all actually came about. the thinking was probably that by doing it this way it would lead into the story quicker, get things moving along. while this is true to a certain extent, some added background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting; the way it was done here merely depreciates the credibility of the entire proceedings. the plot is marginal to begin with, and any time spent on character development would have been well worth the while. what's delivered, and quite unimaginatively at that, is a less than compelling story filled with one dimensional characters. the performances are satisfactory, but the actors get no help from the script, nor apparently from silver; danes, ribisi and epps come close to fleshing out julie, pete and linc, but given the time allotted them, combined with the lack of support, they still fall way short of giving these people life. farina, a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here, comes off as nothing more than a caricature of the `good cop.' there's a feeling that everything was given the once-over in this film; some detail and nuance would have driven the stock up considerably on this one. the supporting cast includes richard jenkins (detective mothershed), steve harris (briggs), larry brandenburg (eckford), lionel mark smith (lanier) and sam mcmurray (tricky). it's a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like this; a lot more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie. as it is, it comes across as ill-conceived and poorly executed. danes, ribisi and epps are like major leaguers who got stuck playing for all the marbles at the local sandlot; instead of getting a shot at the title, they all got hung out to dry. like terry says in `on the waterfront,' `you was my brother, charlie, you shoulda been looking out for me.' well, it's obvious that there was no charlie to look out for them here, and after `the mod squad,' they can all just hope for something better to come along the next time. i rate this one 1/10. I saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and i hadn't seen an almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom. high heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.or so i thought. then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details, like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule. apparently, the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.great, but you know what? it's still a bad movie. it takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film--you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. high heels gives us strange, off-beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies, and almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point. what is the significance, for example, of the hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? why is that even in there? just to surprise us?there is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. and that's it, that's the only entertaining moment. the rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart pedro almodovar is. but no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trickery for a movie to be good. I saw the trailer for this film before watching titanic, and i must admit that it whetted my appetite. volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. but what a damp squib. corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ludicrous. the stupid daughter is just beyond belief - she is supposed to be 13 not 4. but then the scientists,firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more. this movie ranks just in front of cruise ii and twister, but only because those 2 films are completely appalling. this does have some reasonable effects, but overall its a 1 out of 10. don't waste your time. Child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive & controversial combination and therefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to revolve on this topic should receive some extra attention from horror fans. of course, like in the case of \"wicked little things\", controversial themes don't always guarantee a good film. despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric setting and the involvement of video-nasty director j.s. cardone (\"the slayer\"), this is an uninspired and cliché-ridden film that couldn't offer a single fright or shock. after losing their husband and father, the remaining tunny women (mother karen and her daughters sarah and emma) move to a small and remote pennsylvanian mountain town where they inherited an old, ramshackle mansion. their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. strange things start to happen, like young emma befriending an (imaginary?) girl who used to live in their house, and the eerie locals seem to keep secrets from karen and her daughters. quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their mine-graves at night to seek vengeance on the descendants of the mine's owner mr. carlton, who was responsible for their deaths. \"wicked little things\" is rather tame and extremely predictable. the script shamelessly serves one dreadful cliché after the other, like car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial times, malfunctioning flashlights and horridly broken dolls. there's very little suspense, even less gore and the make-up effects are disappointingly weak. the zombified children don't look menacing at all. actually, they all look like miniature versions of marilyn manson, with their black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. the excitement-free finale is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this pointless production. lori heuring is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother, but scout taylor-compton (currently a big star thanks to the \"halloween\" remake) and young chloe moretz are adequate as the daughters. Well, what was fun... except for the fun part.it's my second least favorite so far, i even thought it was worse than 'lazarus' and 'ghost in the machine'.let's start with the good. the teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. being the great animal lover that i am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.but then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful. there were about one or two quotable lines. and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me. in the end... what's the point? they all pretty much died. we didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and i couldn't even find sophia's death sad... just very frustrating.* star. shame because season 2 was doing so well. This show, paranormal state, has an almost \"blairwitch project\" feel to it. as in, you're watching a 'documentary' that's actually just a scripted movie, made to look and feel like a documentary.my biggest problem with the show, is their 'go to' outside advisers of the warren's, who were made famous for their 'investigations' of the amityville murders, which were shown to be completely fraudulent, just based upon the police reports of the family's deaths! (such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) then there's the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything. not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take. they don't want to help those who need it most, they just want the weirdest cases, that will get them the most press and attention.they're complete frauds, plain and simple. Oh man, i know what your thinking: \"with a title like that, i can't go wrong!\" uh yes you can. i too, loved the title, but man i hated the stupid kid that played \"satan's little helper\" i hated the mom too, and the sister/daughter, and her boyfriend - i hated all those people! man, it was agony watching this sometimes! the only reason this doesn't get 1/10 is becuz condsidering the low budget, they did ok. but oh man did i hate those actors, so stupid! i knew it was going to be bad, i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer, and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too. oh the agony, do not watch!. I thought this movie was horrible. i was bored and had to use all the self control i have to not scream at the screen. mod squad was beyond cheesy, beyond cliche, and utterly predictable. \"fred claus\" somehow avoids becoming this year's \"the santa clause\" by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that tim allen starrer, but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater.as holiday movies go, it's contrived and sentimental. but actually, that could be the least of one's concern as \"fred claus,\" boasting of having david dobkin (\"shanghai knights,\" \"the wedding crashers\") at the helm, contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish vince vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy christmas film. in the end, it amounts to not much of both. and with a cast that comprises of paul giamatti, kevin spacey, rachel weisz, and kathy bates, all the more it leaves one disappointed.vaughn plays fred, nick's (giamatti) older and estranged brother, who once upon a time, left him and their parents (bates and trevor peacock) after having had enough of enduring his parents' favoritism of his younger sibling. nick grows up to be santa claus (and as the voice-over tells us, time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint), while fred becomes a yuletide-jaded repo man in chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend wanda's (weisz) birthday.he runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who eerily looks at least a decade older than him) to bail him out of jail. nick agrees but only if fred agrees to help out on the toy-wrapping business up in the north pole. fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with santa and the elves' perpetually cheery nature, even as an efficiency expert (spacey) is checking on the toy factory operations, only too happy to have the whole arctic operations shut down if things fail.the film, as said, does have its moments, but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration. in between are piles of christmas film clichés that were handled better in, say, \"elf\" and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's fruitcake.vaugn, as usual, brings on his coarse charm to the table, but the neutered script of dan fogelman keeps him from really doing his thing. giamatti, underneath the bad fat suit, brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, has to play second fiddle to fred. spacey brings his game face, but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid.ultimately, \"fred claus\" becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve. sure, there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema, but there are certainly far better ways. I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here. but i really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews i read claimed. it was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic. but, the movie was a let down. specially for neone who has seen 'gadar'. inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs, i must say gadar is the better of the two. the story being virtually the same. partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact. over looking kristin kruek's accent and the smallvile image, which in itself wasn't an easy job. the characters just did not seem too real. not that i am criticizing the acting by any of the lead. it just did not work. the atmosphere was well drawn up, but the movie really lacked in substance. not that i am die hard rambo fan, but some action cud have seen the movie through, or some character development. it all seemed like a rush to the finish. and the ending only added to the viewers dissatisfaction.nonetheles, i must say that it was at least a good effort in seemingly unfamiliar territory by the director. and if u haven't seen gadar, then u mite even like it. I was so eager to see this one of my favorite tv shows.i saw universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me.computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name\"the jetsons\" or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic.shortly after that till the end...i couldn't believe my eyes!!!!how lucky i was that i could forget all i had seen.just songs by tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head.anyway,i wish to see this space-aged family (also the flintstones and yogi bear) in all graphic computer design as toy story or bug's life.the best style for hanna-barbera's in my opinion. I saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. i really don't understand what all of the hype was about. for one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad (\"what if something strange is going on?\"...what????). the acting didn't blow my socks off either. it could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and i didn't give a hoot about them at all. another thing is that the movie extremely boring. extremely. sure, there are a couple of \"jolts\" here and there, but for the movie's 112 minute length, it sure didn't use it's time up wisely. most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot. what was the point of that??to top it off, the movie makes no sense. yes, i believe i understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. also, much of the movie is played out in little vignettes, which makes the story hard to follow at times. and don't even get me started with the ending. what exactly happened there?i can give kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film. there are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images. if they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. but they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. yes, it's a message movie. okay, fun. i'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open: find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this. Nicolas roeg ? he directed the classic supernatural thriller don`t look now didn`t he ? strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonight`s screening of cold heaven no favours what so ever . you see it`s impossible not to compare cold heaven with don`t look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child , in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around venice wearing a red anorak . this doesn`t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth . in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and it`s impossible not to notice them . if i didn`t no different i would have thought this was a tvm since it`s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence . roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn`t help the movie at all . one can`t help feeling roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen cheap production values , disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie. I don't really know whether cabin fever is supposed to be a joke or a film... but as far as i know, it's much closer to being a joke than anything else. a few years ago, the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre, thus giving birth to the scream series. a list was given in scream, of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable, and the characters in scream ended up doing exactly the same things, which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre, and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different, either full of irony towards the genre, self-derision towards the film itself, or at least different in their dramatic process than all the \"old\" films that responded to the same tired criteria. in seeing \"cabin fever\", alas, many will see how unoriginal, serious, pretentious, boring and even not scary some supposedly \"scary\" films are now, even a few years later. first of all, this film lacks originality in a way few others do. it has been said several times, how little imagination horror directors have today, remaking remakes of foreign sequels, but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesn't seem to be an \"hommage\" to anything, it seems to be, simply, a ripoff. whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film's story won't be: once again, we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties, who won't think rationally when placed in front of a problem, will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it. not much excitement there either. for the umpteenth time in a horror film, they are tempted to kiss, make love and just basically have fun, all sorts of things that don't really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously. secondly, this film is unimaginatively serious. every situation the characters are in, every dialog, every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying. nothing in the way the film is directed, written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm, which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible-never-heard-of-before-flesh-eating-virus (no laughs please). i won't even bring up the acting, since there are no actors in this film. the cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director. thirdly, and this will strike whoever has seen a \"good\" horror film before, the screenplay is absolutely empty. nothing really happens, some actions are repeated several times (\"let's try to get help!\"), nothing makes sense, either in the facts, the psychology of the characters, or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film, which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters. in the end i will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it. gallons of fake blood, whether they are being vomited, squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds, never were enough to scare an audience. such major features as screenplay, ideas, and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary. if i wasn't considering it to be a total failure, i would agree to reckon that the film has one talent: it is filthy disgusting to watch. yet being grossed-out and being scared are two very different feelings, let it be known.i would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first, why not from the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, films made by wes craven, dario argento, sam raimi, stanley kubrick, david lynch, roger corman, william lustig, john carpenter... it might not only give a good definition of what is scary, or self-derisory horror, but also convince viewers that \"new\" isn't necessarily \"better\". a good example related to the film is the few tracks composer angelo badalamenti provided for this film, even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions, they are below anything he has ever done before. I realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal, in fact, it probably is still brutal today, but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly \"made-for-tv\" movie? also, women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory, and still show the realism of the era  would it make for good viewing? honestly, i don't know. i have thought about this film for the past two days, and i still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film, yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the greatest i have ever seen. from several hodgepodge styles of acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character, to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland. was it good? was it bad? that may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated! this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes. scenes where i wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole. i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale. i do not know much about living in wyoming, especially during the early 1900s, so this film captured that image in my mind. the thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this polaroid-esquire view untouched by corporate america. it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience (though the television). there were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattle-branding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their journey, that just brought a true sense of realism to this story. director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers, but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view.while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film, i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side. rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart, a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell's elinore randall. the two as actors have no chemistry at all. their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion. the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two \"veteran\" actors portrayed it. the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done. this is love? was it supposed to be love? i don't know, i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond, but with torn and ferrell, it felt like two actors just playing their parts. other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse \"knocks\" on the door for food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore's daughter (i just didn't believe it), the lack of true winter struggle, and the entire land scene. the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing, why she was doing it, and why clyde would build her a house if they were married! it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a stronger film.overall, i will go middle of the road with this feature. there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore, but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation. these panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers. while there were some brilliant scenes of realism (starring cattle and pigs), i just felt as if we needed more. depth was a key element lacking in this film, which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story. pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world, but instead left open loopholes and clichéd western characters. ferrell carried her own, but torn was completely miscast. decent for a viewing, but will not be picked up again by me.grade: ** out of *****. This movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean-claud vam damme stars in this movie.there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie.the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all.and this movie by far has to be one of jean-claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport,kickboxer or sudden death.over all this movie is crap/ok and my rating is 4 out of 10. Solo is an action movie about a terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. when a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of central america, where he takes refuge in a village. the military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.mario van peebles does a decent performance the android. his movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. and it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. the acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but i was not expecting anything too good. the special effects were decent as well.solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. it lacks the substance that most movies possess. but if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done. I won't mention any of the plot, because, although it would be highly predictable anyway, the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere, in the movie comments, in the plot summary here, and even in the synopsis on my netflix envelope. i might have enjoyed it more if i hadn't known that. maybe. this film has a deceptively good cast, most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand, including donald sutherland, lesley ann warren, and tia carrere and rosemary dunsmore in smaller parts. it was impossible to like william mcnamara, but that was clearly by design. and there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian lenore zann. but none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me. don't any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing on?. Even allowing for my unabashed love of the first two films in the franchise, and sweeping away any sort of biased leanings i might of had for the character of max, i just can't bring myself to rate at average this cartoonery waste of space that so nearly soils what had gone before it.gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character mad max rockatansky, gone is the impacting feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world, and more crucially, gone is director george miller's passion for the franchise. the dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film, it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third {and thankfully last} instalment. sure the stunts are spot on {to be expected by now}, and of course miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before. yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since the road warrior's crowning glory of the petrol tanker pursuit is replicated here, only he uses a train instead!!.it's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s; but when viewing the three films together now, thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. and the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. i give the film 3/10 purely for one real good thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least. but this is the third time i have tried to like this film, and as glutton for punishment as i undoubtedly am, i wont be trying again, ever. This movie got extremely silly when things started to happen. i couldn't care less about any of the characters; susan walters was so annoying, and the leading actor (forget his name) also got on my nerves. can't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film, things didn't quite carry off. my dad told me it's s stupid movie...i should've listened to him. I feel like i've been had, the con is on, don't fall for it. after reading glowing reviews (the director was a film reviewer with sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews) i expected solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and poetic moments. sadly, 'sixteen years of alcohol', doesn't deliver on the critics promises, for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects (what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for?), unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration, cliché edits and camera angles.'sixteen years of alcohol' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in scotland, but it's straight downhill from here. unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice-over's. the lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted - the audience doesn't care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things...like this movie!. to make matters worse, the 'homage's' (typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters) are either utterly cliché or unconvincing. the soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action.for some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying. i still watched the whole damn thing!i guess i liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter-cut with weird and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes. you don't need a huge budget to make truly moving film, so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film, half a million is not a little bit of money...so no excuses! sometimes i wonder what the actors...or their agents were thinking!pass on this turkey unless you're masochistic or mindless anyway....not my thing1.5/10. My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. they were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. the special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. the whole movie i was waiting for the spiders to show up. the rest of the storyline was really boring. and when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. i didn't watch the whole movie. when it was played for about one hour i switched off my dvd-player. i watch 3 movies almost every night, and i have never walked away from a movie, even if it was that boring. the only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) that's why i voted 2 instead of 1 :) so don't go see this one, instead you should go out and rent starship troopers, it's like the same only 10.000 times better. I somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie, but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered. my friends and i are fans of hk film, but wow. this movie has it all, and by all i mean everything a movie shouldn't have. underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, way over-the-top overacting, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, unfunny \"gags\" and \"jokes\", elementary school premise, mindless killings, and too-long running time for the material. throw in the fact that gen-x cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear. quite simply, if you're entertaining the idea of watching this film...don't. You get a good portion of steven seagal environmental anxieties, and some breathless mountain views along with cow-boy scenes (or alternatively use parts of any remains of the horse whisperer). you then add a large piece of outbreak virus or similar (attention it must be more lethal and at least biohazard level 4) wrapped around a fat militia group leader. you add one teaspoon of martial arts, and a zip of explosions and gunfire for the taste. add the classic red indian herbs for the extra taste. serve immediately.what is the name of the film you get ?: the patriot. perhaps the worst film of steven seagal. i am sure that seagal tried to say something in this film except the usual i-am-a-cook (but-also-an-ex-seal) but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful. Eliza dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. she manages to be the rock-steady centre of \"tru calling\" but that's not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity. it's a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as dushku should go from a meaty supporting role in \"buffy the vampire slayer\" to this clunker. unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, \"tru calling\" fails to excite on any level above hormonal. the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running hither and yon across what must be a very small city, in order to avert the deaths of good-looking corpses-to-be that she's already met in the mortuary where she works. despite all the running she does, she always arrives looking like she's just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. in every episode, eliza dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland, characterless screenplays but it's a pointless exercise. \"tru calling\" just lies on the slab, gazing lifelessly at the ceiling. Aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence, this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours.it starts with an interminably long intro where the leeds family is introduced, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely clichéd pa and ma, and incredibly annoying grandpa (played by charles \"chic\" sales). while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire, and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street. the mobsters flee through the family's house, leaving them as witnesses to the crime.the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the crusading da occasionally interrupting long anti-crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob. it all winds up in a predictable manner.good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating, nat pendleton as one of the mobsters, and the gorgeous sue blane in a small role as the leeds daughter. if you want to watch huston play his early trademark crusading lawman, try 1932's \"beast of the city.\" avoid this one if at all possible. T. rama rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions. he's like stuck with the same old-fashioned film-making style.actors are not bad, not good either. anil kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son, but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. rekha is good, but then - she's always good, and here she's nothing more than such. she makes the best of what she is given, but she always does that. in conclusion, nothing great at all. raveena is ok, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing.this film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. maybe it's a delayed film? well, even then it still would be below standard. the script is terrible, the film is overdone, and the story goes nowhere. it feels like a film made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like from the 1950s.don't recommend, unless you're a big fan one of the starring actors. Just like everybody else have said, the acting is awful, no story or whatsoever, poor directing. about the sfx, the 360 degree, matrix style shooting, 1 shoot is stupid enough, but for each characters. i mean come on gimme a break. and what's up with all those video game scenes, just to remind us it's a \"video game adaptation\"? jesus, they should have fired whoever think up this idea.0.00001/10. I pity people calling kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood ! comeon guys..this movie is a thriller without thrill..come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs.technically good but style over substance kamal doesn't look like a police officer, there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie.kamal at his best is the best in tollywood. This is one of those movies in which people keep saying \"that's a great idea!\" about the worst ideas you've ever heard. then they act on them. i like it. this picture's funnier than any 3 dozen seth rogen projects. well, so is shoah. gojira movies have been cannibalizing their own origin-stories since the 60s, but this one goes further. what can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck? this travesty presents a ww2 suicide brigade on \"the last of the marshall islands\" presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the us marines away. then the japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man, and instead abandon the territory annexed on their behalf by this giant lizard. they retreat to the mainland, where one of them becomes a business tycoon.then it gets complicated.blonde men from the future, irritable over not yet curing male pattern baldness, come back in time in a sort of flying saucer to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in eliminating godzilla before he destroys japan. the \"help\" is questionable, as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closed-circuit tv, but, hey, they shot the script. you would think that by the 90s the japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships. fortunately for nippon, the white guys - you can tell they're american because they say \"nucyaler\" - erred by bringing back in time the one japanese girl left in the future. in a touching display of ancestor worship, she outs their duplicity after donning a flying suit made from ductwork taped to a sailor moon backpack. turns out these time-traveling, fashion-disabled caucasians are just jealous of japan's impending economic imperialist takeover of the known world (in the 22d century japan's going to buy africa, which sounds more like a liability than an asset). these blondes in padded chintz suits with nonfunctioning straps and redundant zippers want to replace godzilla with king ghidorah, who will destroy all of japan except tokyo. a strange choice, but toho's been known to go out of its way not to have to build that tokyo skyline set again.sure enough, we are given the alternate spectacle of fukuoka (\"my garden city\") and some other heretofore unscathed-by-rubber-monster metropolitan areas being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 1/3 of a hydra. in a surprise revelation, we are informed that king ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave. godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down. wait - didn't the spaceship blondes already destroy godzilla? yeah, they killed him in the third reel. but nobody expected that the japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles - \"ha ha, don't worry. we don't keep it in japanese waters\" - with which to jumpstart a new godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur. only they don't have to, because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made godzilla whole again. oh, and godzilla finally gets to tokyo, reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition. they look into each other's eyes, and godzilla nods as if to say, \"gotta do it, man.\" the tycoon nods in understanding. then godzilla blows him up.i should also mention here that, in order to prevent godzilla's revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying japan, the japanese girl from the future goes back to the future to ask for help from - yes - a balding white man. probably because he pities her as the sole asian character from the 23d century, he agrees to build a mecha-ghidora and send it back to the 1990s, so that together, these two giant monsters can, uh, fulfill godzilla's destiny and destroy japan. in a wonderful nod to those notoriously self-willed whipping heads, the girl piloting mecha-ghidora has trouble controlling the joystick.this godzilla suit design owes much to the sumo - his thighs are flabby enough to double for rush limbaugh's, and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous. but there's more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures, which makes up for a lot. also features a man with a passing resemblance to robert patrick playing a killer robot. yes, in the future even the robots will have bald spots. plus megumi odaka, reprising her role as micki, the only japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that. it's not her fault: many japanese directors seem to feel that a seventy-foot screen isn't quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face. i did some acting for japanese television, and i can tell you, they push you to go for it. they apparently urge their writers in the same way. thank god. For me this movie was a disappointment. somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in ww ii. but there is none of that, it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries, in a way, to whitewash him. so i just have to suppose that rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business, without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour. such real life people just do not make good movie material. i almost feel sorry for james mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character. actually, a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie  with the exception of luther adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of adolf hitler.there might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the german speaking world. famous british actors impersonating germans are just not credible. rommel, for example, is perceived here not just as a german but as a typical southerner\" from baden-württemberg. you immediately think of a certain dialect, a certain kind of wit, a certain way of seeing the world (the total opposite of eg a prussian junker\"). i also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of july 20th, many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the german troops to join the western allies against the advancing bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever).the best movie portrayal of an intellectual, intelligent military mind is in my opinion still patton (1970). incidentally, general patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie, a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles. the open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible!. Celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies (the cinema is littered with failed attempts), and one can go on and on speculating why john mellencamp never made it big as an actor. instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects, mellencamp dives right in playing the lead in \"falling from grace\", which he also directed, and the results are as awkward and unbecoming as that title. story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in the sticks, opening up old family wounds, boasts a screenplay by larry mcmurtry, but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly. the supporting cast is decent, including kay lenz (whom it's always nice to see), mariel hemingway and claude akins (who share the one really strong scene in the picture). as for john's acting, he doesn't look particularly comfortable, despite apparent efforts to make him look at home; he seems to be ducking the camera most of the time, and he never connects with the audience in an immediate way. *1/2 from ****. David mackenzie's follow-up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel-good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho-sexual issues with his dead mother. it wants to be gritty, realistic, and mysterious. at the same time, it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult.to meet this end, the film tries hard to be youthful. its poster has hand-drawn letters looking like that of juno. its original soundtrack is comprised of fast-paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok; just a little misguided. but strangely the film is anything but youthful.like young adam this film's central mystery concerns a drowned woman- in this case hallam's mother. young adam keeps its mystery quiet, contemplative, and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come. hallam foe does the opposite. it foregrounds its character's psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters. the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend. hallam swiftly interrupts, asserting his presence in the household. here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie.the mystery surrounding his mother's drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father's girlfriend. the audience can never really trust hallam because, besides being creepy, we think his obsession has led him close to insanity. this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable. right when he's found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home, at first it appearing to be looking for the police. then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother, which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element.while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character, he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs. this movie is in no way mysterious, yet it is not blunt either. it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues, but it adds a very self-conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite. it goes for a soundtrack-heavy, trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings, picks locks, and camps out for the sake of voyeurism. these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward-drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy, giddy, or pleasant. they are more neutral than anything; not propelling the character or story. mackenzie makes you understand hallam, yet he fails to build common ground.he expects you to enjoy hallam's trials and tribulations without much ideological justification. the film hinges on its audience's perspective on voyeurism/the kind of person who engages in it. obviously, most people would be disgusted by it. and hallam foe realizes that, but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions. he goes from person to person, trying to fill his deep void. there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam's love interest kate where she drunkenly says \"i love creepy boys,\" perhaps asking the audience to do the same. the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him (her motivation remains vague throughout) and tries to further us from judging him. it's not hard to like hallam, but it is very hard to participate in his adventure- if it is even an adventure at all. all the while, the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood.great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act, muddy development, and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie. recently this film was re-named for a us release, and for what reason? not only is it more unappealing, but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title 'mister.'. I am an avid b-rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures, so i have a substantial gauge to judge this film by. it easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980's has to offer. it isn't as scary as night of the demons, it isn't as gory as re-animator and lacks the camp value of there's nothing out there. that being said, this film has no value. keep in mind, the movie artwork is for a completely different film. the stills shots on the back of the dvd box aren't taken from this film.violence: $$$ (there is plenty of violence but we've seen it all before. a murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilize).nudity: none story: $$ (the story focuses on francine forbes - who wisely changed her name to forbes riley after this film was made - who accepts a job teaching at a university. people start to die and forbes believes the killer is targeting her. is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student? to be honest, it is impossible to care because the script doesn't flesh out any character outside forbes).acting: $ (terrible on all levels. this slasher has the feel of a school production -high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this. forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is of the \"extras\" caliber of acting). Bad script? check. awful effects? check. horrible actors? check. lame direction? check.after seeing the dvd box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, i placed my $4.28 on the line and rented this \"film.\" my girlfriend was out of town and i was bored so on a late tuesday night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch, what appeared to be (based on the box cover art) a horror movie. what i got instead was the worst film ever made. up until that point i had always declared \"slumber party massacre 3\" the worst film ever made.if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is, this is for you. if you don't want to lose $4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, steer clear of this garbage.an added note: i noticed a few of the \"actors\" come on here and post comments on the bulletin board. how can you brag about being in this film? you were all horrible. i mean really bad. if there was an american idol for actors, you all would be laughed at in the first few episodes.peace.sutter cain. I do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of direction or script. as you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone. it is absolutely distracting and without substance, which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie. i do not write many reviews here, but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment. movies like this erode at movie making as an art form. movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them. people hone there craft, there 5 senses, and there business sense - overlooking there own inner life. however i do not put blame on them, it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age - qualified by films like this one. but by proxy these manufacturers i would dare not call artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen - diffusing it to everyone. a story of bounty hunters, guns guns and more guns, heavy handed flaunting of sex - for the oh so popular actress (did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her?), over saturated, over exaggerated, one liners, non-linear plots. all different and yet all the same. annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat. a story? a development of character? or just withheld, missing information, revealed at the end to create the *effect* of a story - as if one took place. it altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety. it is a caricature of stereotypes and genre. where are the films with awareness? what about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there? what about the depth of a look? what about editing with a point about mind and consciousness? yes even in action films this can happen. sure they have honed a craft; but what use is it without soul or wisdom? of insight into the human condition? can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art, or compare this to picasso and others - i say put this next to gandhi or the godfather, even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings; then look me in the face and say it again. it is a good crew, but they need some help with depth and story. i hope they get it because i like the crews previous work. better luck next time. This time the beastmaster(marc singer) returns only to face off a new enemy arklon(wings hauser) however due to an annoying teenager(kari wuher) they are transported to the future where they then duke it out. lots of (lame) fish out of water jokes ensue. you honestly don't get sequels this rotten to the core. beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to behold. the references and \"hipness\" date the film badly (this was made in 1991) and really who wants to see the beastmaster in the present times? also of note is wings hauser who's embarrassing performance is easily the film's best asset. singer looks awkward, wuher is irritating and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie downright unwatchable. this is easily one of the worst movies ever made.1/2* out of 4-(awful). Nothing in this film interested me. i thought the actors were asleep while they were performing. that's not laid-back stanislofsky method, that's just walking-through and saying lines, i'm afraid. kidman's performance is sad. the story is, however, mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting. One of the lamer wedding movies you'll see. smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters. the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke, except they just aint in the least bit funny here. molly ringwald, well what else needs to be said. give you a clue to the silliness, she destroys a $10,000 wedding dress, because \"it just won't be me\" makes it into this rag, with straps and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy, rather than ringwalding her neck. its a helluva a cast too, check out how heavy ally sheedy is. wheeeew!. Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. it does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. and all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. i was actually shocked when i realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable \"twist\") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another \"twist.\" it's all totally mechanical, right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about.). Please avoid this movie at all costs. this is without a doubt, the worst movie i've ever seen. most movies have at least one redeeming value. this has none. totally horrible!. Effort aside (this isn't a review about good intentions, its about the final product), this film is poorly written, overacted, and poorly directed. the story obviously had potential, but that story is nowhere present in this film.clara barton was a human being. she had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self doubt just like the rest of us. you would never know that from this film of the lead actress's performance. in fact apply that to every character in the film, but in barton's case: every sentence is a speech. an epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot. in fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting, and i realized thats because she's making a speech! every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot. for example, when she sees a wounded man, she'll start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags, etc. as played in the film, there's no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds.in conclusion, this film robs clara barton of her struggles. it robs her of her humanity, and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clichés. the writer doesn't know clara barton, and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia britannica article. (yes they had those back then) but hey, nice technicolor! (who cares). This belabored and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two buffoonish (one idealistic, one drug addled) california kids dealing secrets to the kgb never seems to get enough steam up to sustain any tension and suspense before it dies a very slow death over two hours later. john schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he was asleep in his director's chair most of the time as the film lags and the actors sleep walk, save for the highly annoying over the top performance of sean penn. childhood altar boys and friends chris (tim hutton) and daulton (penn) devise a plan to sell secrets to the kgb when chris lands a job that allows him access to top secret government materials. disillusioned by what he sees as us meddling in foreign affairs the idealistic chris and the drug hungry daulton make contact with the russians and begin to funnel them classified materials. when chris decides he wants out things begin to unravel at a lackadaisical pace. the eighties were not kind to distinguished director john schlesinger. in the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both england and america but then came honky tonk freeway in 1981 and it marked the beginning of the end. the falcon and the snowman more or less put a lid on it. lacking the suspense of marathon man and the quality performances (hoffman voight, christie, jackson, finch, olivier) he had coaxed from leads in the past falcon goes in circles most of the way. sean penn chews scenery from start to finish in such an obnoxious fashion you find yourself encouraging his torturers to do more to him. tim hutton is governed by his limited acting chops and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time. lori singer as hutton's girlfriend plays it mute most of the way with schlesinger content to film her vapid expressions. when she does emote you understand why. only david suchet as the kgb handler with a piercing eyed introspective presence and restraint acquits himself well.\n"
